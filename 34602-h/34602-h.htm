<p id="preface">Like the love of music, books and pictures,
the love of gardens comes with culture and leisure
and with the ripening of the home life.
The love of gardens, as of every other beautiful
and refining thing, must increase to the end of
time. More and more must the sympathies
enlarge. There must be more points of contact
with the world. Life ever becomes richer.
Gardening is more than the growing of plants:
it is the expression of desire.</p>

<p>As there must be many gardeners, so there
must be many books. There must be books for
different persons and different ideals. The garden
made by one’s own hands is always the best
garden, because it is a part of oneself. A garden
made by another may interest, but it is another
person’s individuality. A poor garden of
one’s own is better than a good garden in which
one may not dig. Many a poor soul has more
help in a plant in the window than another has
in a plantation made by a gardener.</p>

<p>I would emphasize the home garden, made by
the members of the family. I would preach the
beauty of the common plants and the familiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
places. These things are never old. Many
times I have noted how intently an audience of
plant-lovers will listen to the most commonplace
details respecting the cultivation of plants with
which they have been always familiar. There
was nothing new in what they heard; but they
liked to have the old story told over again, and
every detail called up a memory.</p>

<p>The same questions are asked every year, and
they always will be asked,&mdash;the questions about
the simplest garden operations. Upon this desire
for commonplace advice the horticultural
journals live. A journal which publishes only
things that are new would find little support.
Some of these common questions I have tried to
answer in this little book. I wish them answered
in the simple and direct phrase of the gardener.
Therefore I asked my friend C. E. Hunn, gardener
to the Horticultural Department of Cornell
University, who lives with plants, to write advice
for one who would make a garden; and
this he did in a summer vacation. These notes,
edited and amplified, now make this book.</p>

<p><a name="A" id="A"></a><b>Abobra viridiflora.</b> A handsome tender climber
with tuberous roots, that may be taken up in the fall and
stored in a cellar. The foliage is dark and glossy, the flowers
small and inconspicuous; but the small scarlet fruits are
very effective in contrast to the leaves, making it a desirable
screen plant. It is sold by seedsmen. Seeds sown as soon
as warm weather comes will give plants which bloom in the
open (in a warm soil and exposure), and which reach a
height of 5-8 ft. It is sometimes grown as a glasshouse
plant. It is cucurbitaceous (allied to melons and gourds).</p>

<p><b>Abronia.</b> Californian trailing perennials, but
treated as hardy annuals. They thrive in any warm, open garden
soil, and are very satisfactory for the margins of beds or
borders. The little flowers are borne in clusters. <i>A. latifolia</i>
or <i>arenaria</i> (yellow) and <i>A. umbellata</i> or <i>grandiflora</i>
(pink) are the leading kinds. Usually sown where they
are to bloom. Peel the husk off the seed before sowing.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 161px;">
<img src="images/001-abutilon.jpg" width="161" height="170" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Abutilon striatum</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="abutilon" id="abutilon"></a>Abutilons</b>, or <span class="smcap">Flowering Maples</span> as they are
called by many, make fine house or bedding plants. Common
kinds may be grown from seed or from cuttings of
young wood. If the former, the seed should be sown in
February or March in a temperature of not less than 60°.
The seedlings should be potted when from four to six leaves
have grown, in a rich, sandy soil. Frequent pottings should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
be made to insure a rapid growth, making plants large
enough to flower by fall. Or, the seedlings may be planted
out in the border when danger of frost is over, and taken up
in the fall before frost: these plants will bloom all winter.
About one-half of the newer growth should be cut off when
they are taken up, as they are very apt to spindle up when
grown in the house. When grown from cuttings, young
wood should be used, which, after being well rooted, may
be treated in the same manner as the seedlings.
The varieties with variegated leaves have been
improved until the foliage effects are equal to
the flowers of some varieties; and, these are a
great addition to the conservatory or window
garden. The staple spotted-leaved type is <i>A.
Thompsoni</i>. A compact form, now much used
for bedding and other outdoor work, is <i>Savitzii</i>,
which is a horticultural variety, not a distinct
species. The old-fashioned green-leaved <i>A. striatum</i>, from
which <i>A. Thompsoni</i> has probably sprung, is one of the
best. <i>A. megapotamicum</i> or <i>vexillarium</i> is a trailing or
drooping red-and-yellow-flowered species, which is excellent
for baskets. It propagates readily from seed. Abutilons
are most satisfactory for house plants when they are
not much more than a year old. They need no special
treatment.</p>

<p><b>Aconitum.</b> <span class="smcap">Monk’s Hood. Wolf’s Bane.</span>
Hardy herbaceous perennials allied to larkspurs. They are
showy border plants, usually flowering the first year from
seed, if the seed is started early, and bearing panicles of
quaint hood-shaped, rich flowers. The colors have a wide
range, but are usually deep blue. The improved varieties
are much superior in size and markings. Aconitums are
most effective when planted in a mixed border: the flower
stalks being held well up, show the blossoms to good advantage.
Seed may be sown every two years, as the plants
in their year-old and 2-year-old stage have the largest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
blossoms. Sow in gentle heat in March, transplanting to
border when the weather is settled. Roots may be divided
if desired, but best results are to be expected from seedlings.
<i>A. Napellus</i> is the commonest one. The plants are
very poisonous if eaten. Bloom in early summer. 2-3 ft.</p>

<p><b>Acroclinium.</b> A low-growing everlasting annual
flower, white, violet, or rose in color. Seeds should
preferably be started in a hotbed or window, and planted
out when danger of frost is past; the flowers should be
gathered when half expanded and hung
in the shade to dry. Half-hardy.
Plant 1 foot apart. Grow 10-15 in.
high. <a href="#everlastings">See <i>Everlastings</i>.</a></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;">
<img src="images/003-adlumia.jpg" width="226" height="269" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Adlumia cirrhosa</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="adlumia" id="adlumia"></a>Adlumia.</b> <span class="smcap">Mountain Fringe.
Allegheny Vine.</span> One of the daintiest
of climbers, making a very rapid growth,
and when once established seeding itself
and thriving for years, growing 10 or
15 feet in a season. Give rich, rather
moist soil. It is biennial, blooming the
second year. Flowers like those of the
bleeding heart and other dicentras. It is native.</p>

<p><b>Adonis.</b> A low-growing hardy annual or perennial
of the easiest culture. It makes a fine mass effect,
as the flowers are a striking dark scarlet or crimson color,
and the plants are very free and continuous bloomers.
Sow early in the spring where wanted. The perennial
yellow-flowered sorts sometimes bloom the first year from
seed. Adonises are very neat in habit, and the foliage is
fine and interesting. 10-15 in.</p>

<p><b>Agapanthus.</b> <span class="smcap">African Lily.</span> A tuberous-rooted,
well known conservatory or window plant. It lends
itself to many conditions and proves satisfactory a large part
of the year, the leaves forming a green arch over the pot,
covering it entirely in a well grown specimen. The flowers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
are borne in a large cluster on stems growing from 2 to 3
ft. high, as many as two or three hundred bright blue flowers
often forming on a single plant. A large, well grown
plant throws up a number of flower-stalks through the
early season. The one essential to free growth is an abundance
of water and an occasional application of manure
water. Propagation is effected by division of the offsets,
which may be broken from the main plant in early spring.
After flowering, gradually lessen the quantity of water until
they are placed in winter quarters, which should be a position
free from frost and moderately dry. The Agapanthus,
being a heavy feeder, should be grown in strong loam to
which is added well rotted manure and a little sand.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/004-ageratum.jpg" width="70" height="173" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Ageratum</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ageratum.</b> A half-hardy annual, used as a
border plant, for ribbon bedding for mass effect, or in
mixed beds of geranium, coleuses and other plants. The
seeds germinate readily, but as the plant is only
half-hardy and is usually wanted in flower when
planted out, it is usual to sow the seed in boxes
placed in hotbeds or windows in March, transplanting
the seedlings to small boxes or pots and
growing the young plants on until the 1st of May,
when they may be planted out. Pieces of young
wood root very easily, and the gardener usually
increases his stock by cuttings. The dwarf varieties
are the most desirable, and the two colors,
blue and white, may be planted together. 2-3 ft. Plants
may be taken up in the fall and set in the house; cut them
back severely.</p>

<p><b>Allegheny Vine.</b> <a href="#adlumia">See <i>Adlumia</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Almond</b> is about as hardy as the peach, but it
blooms so early in the spring that it is little grown east of
the Pacific slope. It is an interesting ornamental tree, and
its early bloom is a merit when the fruit is not desired.
The Almonds commonly sold by nurserymen in the east are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
hard-shell varieties, and the nuts are not good enough for
commerce. The Almond fruit is a drupe, like the peach,
but the flesh is thin and hard and the pit is the “Almond”
of commerce. Culture the same as for peach.</p>

<p>Flowering Almond is a very early-flowering bush, excellent
for shrub-borders. It is usually grafted on plum
stock, and one must take care to keep down the plum sprouts
which sometimes spring from the root.</p>

<p><b>Aloe.</b> Succulent tropical plants, sometimes seen
in window gardens. Of easy culture. See that the pots
have perfect drainage. Make a soil of sandy loam, with
one-third or one-fourth part of broken brick. Pot firmly.
Water whenever needed, but the soil and drainage should
be such that the earth does not remain soggy or become
sour. Aloes thrive year after year without repotting.
Usually propagated by cuttings. <i>A. variegata</i> is the commonest
species.</p>

<p><b>Alonsoa.</b> Tender annual. Not very well known,
but a bright plant for second-row border or a low bedding
plant. Planted against shrubbery or other protection after
danger of frost is over, it lightens up a dark corner. 2-3 ft.
Plant 10-15 in. apart, in a warm place protected from wind.</p>

<p><b>Alströmeria.</b> The Alströmerias belong to the
amaryllis family, being tuberous-rooted plants, having leafy
stems and terminating in a cluster of from 10 to 50 small
lily-shaped flowers of rich colors. Most of the kinds should
be given pot culture, as they are easily grown and are not
hardy in the open in the north. The culture is nearly that of
the amaryllis,&mdash;a good, fibrous loam with a little sand, potting
the tubers in early spring or late fall. Start the plants
slowly, giving only water enough to cause root growth; but
after growth has become established, a quantity of water may
be given. After flowering they may be treated as are amaryllis
or agapanthus. The plants grow 1-2½ ft. high. The
flowers often have odd colors.</p>

<img src="images/006-alyssum.jpg" width="148" height="253" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Sweet Alyssum</p>
</div>

<p><b>Alyssum, Sweet.</b> A low-growing, hardy, white-flowered,
very fragrant annual which is much used for edgings,
window boxes, and the like. It is of the easiest culture
in any soil, but thrives best in a garden loam of moderate
fertility. Seeds may be sown as early as the
ground can be well prepared in spring. The plant
will begin to bloom when 2 or 3 inches high, and
continue to bloom, as it grows, until after the
first hard frosts. It makes a mat 1 to 2 ft.
across. If immediate effects are not desired,
the plants should be thinned out or transplanted
to stand half a foot apart. It rarely stands more
than a foot high. In the fall, plants may be cut
back and put into pots or boxes, and they will
bloom in the window. Better results in winter
blooming are secured by starting seeds in boxes in August,
September or October. There are certain hardy perennial
yellow-flowered Alyssums which are useful for prominent
edgings and for rockwork.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 126px;">
<img src="images/006-prince.jpg" width="126" height="159" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Prince’s Feather</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="amarantus" id="amarantus"></a>Amarantus.</b> Decorative annuals. One species
(with erect spikes) is known as <span class="smcap">Prince’s Feather</span>, another
(with variegated foliage) as <span class="smcap">Joseph’s Coat</span>, and still another
(with drooping spikes) as <span class="smcap">Love-lies-bleeding</span>.
Probably the finest of the list is <i>A. salicifolius</i>,
often called Fountain Plant. This has graceful
willow-shaped leaves, banded and tipped with
carmine, bronze and orange. The tall kinds
make fine screens for unsightly objects. They
may also be used against masses of green to add
color. The Amaranths are half-hardy or tender
plants, and should be sown in boxes in March or
April, to be planted out after all danger of frost is past.
Seeds may also be sown where the plants are to stand.
They were once among the most popular of garden plants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
but for a few years have been neglected. Fine colors have
recently been developed, and they are again becoming favorites.
As they are rather coarse and weedy plants, do not
use them with dainty flowers. Most kinds grow 2-3 ft. high
and spread 2-3 ft.</p>

<p><b><a name="amaryllis" id="amaryllis"></a>Amaryllis.</b> Popular name of a variety of house
or conservatory tender bulbs, but properly applied only to
the Belladonna Lily. Most of them are hippeastrums, but
the culture of all is similar. They are satisfactory house
plants. The one objection to their culture is the habit of
the flower-stalk starting into growth before the leaves start.
This is caused in most cases by stimulating root growth before
the bulb has had sufficient rest. The bulbs should be
dormant for four or five months in a dry place with a temperature
of about 50°. When wanted to be brought into flower,
the bulbs, if to be repotted, should have all the dirt shaken
off and potted in soil composed of fibrous loam and leaf-mold,
to which should be added a little sand. If the loam
is a heavy one, place the pot in a warm situation; a spent
hotbed is a good place. Water as needed, and as the flowers
develop liquid manure may be given. If large clumps are
well established in 8- or 10-inch pots, they may be top-dressed
with new soil containing rotted manure, and as growth increases
liquid manure may be given twice a week until the
flowers open. After flowering, gradually withhold water until
the leaves die. The most popular species for window gardens
is <i>A. Johnsoni</i> (properly a hippeastrum), with red flowers.</p>

<p><b>Amethyst.</b> <a href="#browallia">See <i>Browallia</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Ammobium.</b> A half-hardy perennial everlasting
with white flowers. Thrives best in sandy soil. Sow
seeds where plants are to stand. Although perennial, it
blooms the first year from seed, and is usually treated as an
annual. 2-3 ft. high. Plant 12-18 in. apart.</p>

<p><b>Ammoniacal Carbonate of Copper.</b> <a href="#bordeaux">See under
<i>Bordeaux Mixture</i>.</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<b>Anchusa.</b> Hardy annuals and perennials, fit
for heavy borders. The plants grow to the height of 2 to 3
feet and bear purple or blue flowers, which are showy either
on the plant or in bouquets. Propagated from seed sown in
early spring, either where the plants are to stand or in boxes
or hotbeds. The common kind is annual. Blooms in
summer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 74px;">
<img src="images/008-anemone.jpg" width="74" height="162" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Spray of Anemone Japonica</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="anemone" id="anemone"></a>Anemone.</b> <span class="smcap">Wind Flower.</span> A group of hardy
perennials. The best known of this genus is <i>A. Japonica
alba</i>, or Honorine Jobert. This species blooms from
August to November, and is at that season the finest
of border plants. The pure white flowers, with
lemon-colored stamens, are held well up on stalks
2-3 ft. high. The flower stems are long and excellent
for cutting. This species may be propagated
by division of the plants or by seed. The
former method should be put into practice in the
spring; the latter as soon as the seeds are ripe in
the fall. Sow the seed in boxes in a warm, sheltered
situation in the border or under glass. The seed
should be covered lightly with soil containing a quantity
of sand and not allowed to become dry. A well enriched,
sheltered position in a border should be given. There are
red-flowered varieties.</p>

<p>The varieties of <i>A. coronaria</i> are tuberous-rooted plants.
The tubers of these should be planted in the fall, late in
September or early in October, in a well enriched, sheltered
border, setting the tubers 3 in. deep and from 4-6 in. apart.
The surface of the border should be mulched with leaves or
strawy manure through the severe winter weather, uncovering
the soil in March. The flowers will appear in April or
May, and in June or July the tubers should be taken up and
placed in a dry place in sand until the following fall. This
section is not as well known as it should be. The range
of color is very wide. The flowers are often 2 in. across,
and are lasting. These tubers may be planted in pots in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the same manner as in the border, bringing them into the
conservatory or house at intervals through the winter,
where they make an excellent showing when in bloom.</p>

<p>The little wild Wind Flowers are easily colonized in a
hardy border.</p>

<p><b><a name="annuals" id="annuals"></a>Annuals.</b> The annual flowers of the seedsmen
are those which give their best bloom in the very year
in which the seeds are sown. True annuals are those
plants which complete their entire life-cycle in one season.
Some of the so-called annual flowers will continue to bloom
the second and third years, but the bloom is so poor and
sparse after the first season that it does not pay to keep
them.</p>

<p>Most annuals will bloom in central New York if the seeds
are sown in the open ground when the weather becomes
thoroughly settled. But there are some kinds, as Cosmos
and Moonflowers, for which our season is commonly too
short to give good bloom. These kinds may be started early
in the house or in hotbeds; and similar treatment may be
given any plants of which it is desired
to secure blooms before the normal time.</p>

<p>Prepare the ground thoroughly and
deep. Annuals must make a quick
growth. See that the soil contains
enough humus or vegetable mold to
make it rich and to enable it to
hold moisture. If the ground is
not naturally rich, spade in well-rotted
manure or mold from the
woods. A little commercial fertilizer
may help in starting off the
plants quickly. Prepare the land
as early in spring as it is in fit condition, and prevent
evaporation by keeping the surface loose by means of
raking.</p>

<p>If the flowers are to be grown about the edges of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
lawn, make sure that the grass roots do not run underneath
them and rob them of food and moisture. It is well to run
a sharp spade deep into the ground about the edges of the
bed every two or three weeks for the purpose of cutting
off any grass roots which may have run into the
bed. If beds are made in the turf, see that they are
3 ft. or more wide, so that the grass roots will not
undermine them. Against the shrub borders,
this precaution may not be necessary. In fact,
it is desirable that the flowers fill all the
space between the overhanging branches and
the sod.</p>

</div>

<p>Sow the seeds freely. Many will not germinate.
Even if they do all germinate, the combined
strength of the rising plantlets will break the crust on
the hard soils; and in the thinning which follows, only strong
and promising plants are allowed to remain. Better effects
are also often secured when the colors are in masses, especially
if the flowers are thrown into the bays of heavy shrub
borders.</p>

<p>Plants continue to bloom for a longer period if they are
not allowed to produce seeds. The flowers should be picked,
if possible, as soon as they begin to fade.</p>

<p>In the selection of the kinds of annuals, one’s personal
preference must be the guide. Yet there are some groups
which may be considered to be standard or general-purpose
plants. They are easily grown almost anywhere, and are
sure to give satisfaction. The remaining plants are mostly
such as have secondary value, or are adapted to particular
purposes or uses.</p>

<p>The groups which most strongly appeal to the writer as
staple or general-purpose types are the following: Petunias,
phloxes, pinks or dianthuses, larkspurs or delphiniums,
calliopsis or coreopsis, pot marigold or calendula, bachelor’s
button or <i>Centaurea Cyanus</i>, clarkias, zinnias, marigolds or
tagetes, collinsias, gilias, California poppies or eschscholtzias,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
verbenas, poppies, China asters, sweet peas, nemophilas,
portulacas, silenes, candytufts or iberis, alyssum, stocks or
matthiolas, morning-glories, nasturtiums or tropæolums.</p>

<p>Annual flowers possess a great advantage over perennials
in the fact that they appeal strongly to the desire for experiment.
The seeds are sown every year, and there is sufficient
element of uncertainty in the results to make the effort
interesting; and new combinations can be tried each year.</p>

<p>Do not cut the old stalks down in the fall. They will
stand in the snow all through the winter, and remind you of
the bursting summer time and the long-ripening fall; and
the snow-birds will find them in the short days of winter.</p>

<p><b>Apple</b>, the “King of Fruits,” thrives over a
wider range of territory and under more varied conditions
than any other tree fruit. This means that it is easy to
grow. In fact, it is so easy to grow that it usually is
neglected; and people wonder why the trees do not bear.</p>

<p>The selection of varieties of Apples for home use is, to a
large extent, a personal matter; and no one may say what
to plant. A variety that is successfully grown in one section
may prove disappointing in another. One should study
the locality in which he wishes to plant and choose those
varieties which are the most successfully grown there,&mdash;choosing
from amongst the successful kinds those which he
likes best and which seem best to meet the purposes for
which he is to grow them. When the selection is made, the
trees should be procured from a near-by nurseryman, if
possible, as one is then able to select his own trees, receive
them in the shortest time, and plant them before they have
become dry.</p>

<p>The land on which an orchard is to be planted should
have been in cultivation at least two years previous to setting
the trees and be in a fine physical condition. Dig
the hole broad and deep enough to take in all the roots left
after pruning off the bruised ends caused by digging up the
tree, and trim back the branches at least two-thirds, making a
smooth cut. Set the trunk in the center of the hole, and
sift the fine dirt down through the roots, slightly lifting the
tree once or twice in order that the fine soil may settle under
the roots, making congenial soil for the new roots to run
through. Fill in over the roots, gradually firming the soil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
above with the feet. When the hole is full, firm the
soil around the trunk to prevent whipping by the
wind, leaving the surface level. If the trees are set in the
fall a slight earthing up to the trunk may be beneficial
in certain soils, and if set in a dry
spring a mulch of straw or grass
will benefit them. Two- or 3-year-old
trees (usually the latter) are
the most desirable for planting
in home grounds. Commercial
orchards are often planted exclusively
with 2-year-olds.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 264px;">
<img src="images/015-apples.jpg" width="264" height="155" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Spray of Apples</p>
</div>

<p>In orchard cultivation, Apple trees are usually planted
35 to 40 ft. apart each way. In home grounds they may be
placed somewhat closer than this, especially if they are
planted upon the boundaries, so that the limbs may project
freely in one direction.</p>

<p>It is ordinarily advisable, especially in the humid climates
east of the Great Lakes, to have the body of the tree 3½ to
4½ ft. long. The limbs should be trimmed up to this point
when the tree is set. From three to five main branches
may be left to form the framework of the top. These should
be shortened back one-fourth or one-half when the tree is set.
Subsequent pruning should keep the top of the tree open
and maintain it in more or less symmetrical form. <a href="#pruning">See
<i>Pruning</i>.</a></p>

<p>In orchard conditions, the trees should be kept in clean
culture, especially for the first few years; but this is not
always possible in home yards. In lieu of tillage, the sward
may be mulched each fall with stable manure, and commercial
fertilizer may be applied each fall or spring. If fruit is
wanted rather than foliage and shade, care should be taken
not to make ground too rich but to keep it in such condition that
the tree is making a fairly vigorous growth, with good strong
foliage, but is not overgrowing. An Apple tree in full bearing
is usually in good condition if the twigs grow from 10 to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
18 in. each season. All leaf-eating insects may be kept off
by spraying with Paris green. The Appleworm or codlin-moth
may be kept in check by spraying with Paris green as
soon as the blossoms fall, and again a week or ten days
later. The leaf blight or apple-scab fungus may be kept in
check by spraying with Bordeaux mixture just before the
flowers open, and again after they fall (<a href="#spraying">see <i>Spraying</i></a>). A
close watch should be kept for borers. Whenever the bark
appears to be dead or sunken in patches, remove it and
search for the cause. A borer will usually be found underneath
the bark. About the base of the tree the most serious
injury occurs from borers, since the insect which enters
there bores into the hard wood. His presence can be determined
by the chips which are cast from his burrows. The
only remedy is to dig out the larvæ. If they have got far
into the wood, they can be killed by running a flexible wire
into the burrows.</p>

<p>Apple trees should begin to bear when three to five years
planted, and at ten years should be bearing good crops.
With good treatment, they should continue to bear for thirty
or more years. It is cheaper to buy trees from the nursery
than to attempt to raise them for oneself.</p>

<p>The dwarf Apples are secured by grafting any variety
on the Paradise or Doucin stocks, which are simply small-growing
varieties of Apples. Dwarfs are much used in the Old
World. There is no reason why they should not be used for
home gardens in this country. They may be planted 8 to
10 ft. apart, and trained in various ways. The body or
trunk should not be more than 1 or 2 ft. long. The top
should be headed-in each year a third or a half of the annual
growth. Dwarfs bear sooner than standards. A dwarf in
full bearing should produce from a peck to a bushel of
apples. Usually only the finer or dessert variety of Apples
should be grown on dwarf trees.</p>

<p>Many of the local varieties of Apples are excellent
for home use. From the following list of dessert varieties,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
one can select a good assortment for the home
garden:</p>

<p><i>Summer.</i>&mdash;Early Joe, Primate, Garden Royal, Summer
Pearmain, Early Harvest, Summer Rose, Sweet Bough, Summer
Queen, Early Strawberry, Williams Favorite.</p>

<p><i>Fall.</i>&mdash;Chenango, Dyer, Jefferis, Jersey Sweet, Maiden

<p><b>Apricot.</b> This fruit, usually thought to be too
tender for the winters in the latitude of New York, has
proved as hardy as the peach. Given the right conditions
as to soil and exposure, it will yield abundant crops, ripening
its fruits about three weeks in advance of early peaches.
It would seem that more attention should be given to its
cultivation. In western New York commercial orchards are
now producing crops of as fine fruit as that brought from
California. The introduction of the Russian varieties, a few
years ago, added to the list several desirable kinds that have
proved hardier and a little later in blooming than the old
kinds. The fruits of the Russian varieties, while not as
large as the other varieties, fully equal many of them in
flavor, and they are very productive. The soil for Apricots
should be rather dry; especially should the subsoil be
such that no water may stand around the roots. The exposure
should be to the north or west to retard the blooming
period, as the one great drawback to their successful fruiting
is the early blooming and subsequent freezing of the flowers
or small fruits.</p>

<p>The two serious difficulties in the growing of Apricots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
are the ravages of the curculio (<a href="#plum">see <i>Plum</i></a>) and the danger
to the flowers from the spring frosts. It is usually almost
impossible to secure fruits from one or two isolated Apricot
trees, because the curculios will take them all. It is possible,
also, that some of the varieties need cross-pollination.
The Apricot usually thrives best on strong soil; but otherwise
the treatment which is given the peach suits the Apricot
very well. The Russian varieties bear more profusely
and with less care than the old-fashioned and larger kinds.
Amongst the best kinds of Apricots are Montgamet, Jackson,
Royal, St. Ambroise, Early Golden, Harris, Roman and
Moorepark. In the east, Apricots are commonly worked on
plums, but they also thrive on the peach.</p>

<p><b>Aquarium.</b> A pleasant adjunct to a living
room or conservatory is a large glass globe or glass box
containing water, in which plants and animals are living
and growing. A solid glass tank or globe is better than
a box with glass sides, because it does not leak, but the
box must be used if one wants a large Aquarium. For
most persons it is better to buy the Aquarium box than to
attempt to make it. Four things are important in making
and keeping an Aquarium (according to Miss Rogers, in
Cornell Nature-Study Leaflet No. 11):</p>

<p>“(1) The equilibrium between plant and animal life
must be secured and maintained. Animals do not thrive in
water where no plants are growing. Nature keeps plants
and animals in the same pond, and we must follow her lead.
The plants have three valuable functions in the Aquarium.
First, they supply food for the herbivorous creatures.
Second, they give off a quantity of oxygen which is necessary
to the life of the animals. Third, they take up from
the water the poisonous carbonic acid gas which passes
from the bodies of the animals. Just how the plants do
this is another story. (2) The Aquarium must be ventilated.
Every little fish, snail and insect wants air. A
certain quantity of air is mixed with the water, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
creatures must breathe that or come to the surface for their
supply. How does Mother Nature manage the ventilation
of her aquaria, the ponds and streams? The plants furnish
part of the air, as we have seen. The open pond,
whose surface is ruffled by every passing breeze, is constantly
being provided with fresh air. A tadpole or a fish
can no more live in a long-necked bottle than a boy can
live in a chimney. (3) The temperature should be kept
between 40° and 50° Fahr. Both nature and experience
teach us this. A shady corner is a better place for the
Aquarium than a sunny window on a warm day. (4) It is
well to choose such animals for the Aquarium as are
adapted to life in still water. Unless one has an arrangement
of water pipes to supply a constant flow of water
through the Aquarium, it is best not to try to keep creatures
that we find in swift streams. Practical experience shows
that there are certain dangers to guard against. Perhaps
the most serious results come from overstocking. It is
better to have too few plants or animals than too many of
either. A great deal of light, especially bright sunlight, is
not good for the Aquarium. A pond that is not shaded
soon becomes green with a thick growth of slime, or algæ.
This does not look well in an Aquarium, and is apt to take
up so much of the plant-food that the other plants are
starved out. The plants in the school-room window will
shade the Aquarium nicely, just as the trees and shrubs on
its banks shade the pond. If we find this slime forming
on the light side of our miniature pond we put it in a darker
place, shade it heavily so that the light comes in from the
top only, and put in a few more snails. These will make
quick work of the green slime, for they are fond of it, if we
are not.”</p>

<p>The aquatic plants of the neighborhood may be kept in
the Aquarium,&mdash;such things as myriophyllums, charas, eel-grass,
duckmeats or lemnas, cabomba or fish grass, arrowleafs
or sagittaria, and the like; also the parrot’s feather,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to be bought of florists (a species of myriophyllum). Of animals,
there are fishes (particularly minnows), water insects,
tadpoles, clams, snails. If the proper balance is maintained
between plant and animal life, it will not be necessary
to change the water so frequently.</p>

<p><b>Aquatics and Bog Plants.</b> Many water plants
are easily grown, and make a fine addition to the home
garden. The sedges and other bog plants, the cyperus or
umbrella plant, the common wild water lily, and in large
grounds the nelumbium or Egyptian lotus, all may be grown
with ease. For restricted grounds any of these, with the
exception of the nelumbium, may be grown in tubs made by
sawing an oaken barrel in two, filling each half from one-third
to one-half with soil composed of good loam, sand
and leaf-mold, setting the plants well into the soil and filling
the tubs with water. These tubs should be sunk to the
rim in the borders or lawn, both for a good appearance and
to prevent too great evaporation. By a little care in filling
with water, these plants may be well grown through the
hottest weather. Most of the foreign water lilies are not
hardy, but some of them may be grown with ease if the
pond is covered in winter.</p>

<p>Native Aquatics may be colonized in streams or ponds.
If artificial ponds are to be made, do not get them too deep.
A foot or 15 inches is sufficient depth of water to stand
above the crowns of the plants; and the greatest depth of
water should not be more than 2½ ft. for all kinds of
water lilies. Half this depth is often sufficient. The soil
should be 1 to 2 ft. deep, and very rich. Cow manure may
be mixed with rich loam. Roots of hardy water lilies may
be planted as soon as the pond is clear of frost, but the
tender kinds (which are also to be taken up in the fall)
should not be planted till it is time to plant out geraniums.
Sink the roots into the mud so that they are just buried, and
weight them down with a stone or clod. In cold climates,
protect the pond of hardy Aquatics by throwing boards over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the pond and covering with hay, straw or evergreen boughs.
It is well to supply an additional depth of water as a further
protection.</p>

<p><b><a name="aquilegia" id="aquilegia"></a>Aquilegia.</b> <span class="smcap">Columbine.</span> These hardy perennials
are general favorites for borders and rockwork.
Blooming early in the season, they may be said to head the
procession of the perennials. The ease with which they
may be cultivated, their freedom of bloom, their varied
colors and odd shape entitle them to the front rank among
hardy plants. They are propagated by division of the
plants in the spring or from seed sown in the fall. Seedlings
may be expected to bloom well the second year. They
require a moist, partially sheltered situation, with exposure
to the sun. The common wild Columbine (often called
“honeysuckle”) is easily grown and is very attractive.
Clumps of Columbine should stand 12-18 in. apart. 2-3 ft.
high.</p>

<p><b>Araucaria</b>, or <span class="smcap">Norfolk Island Pine</span>, is now
sold in pots by florists as a window plant. The common
species (<i>A. excelsa</i>) is most excellent for this purpose, making
a symmetrical evergreen subject. It keeps well in
a cool window, or on the veranda in the summer. Protect
it from direct sunlight, and give plenty of room. If the
plant begins to fail, return it to the florist for recuperation.</p>

<p><b>Argemone.</b> <a href="#prickly">See <i>Prickly Poppy</i>.</a></p>

<p><b><a name="aristolochia" id="aristolochia"></a>Aristolochia</b>, or <span class="smcap">Dutchman’s Pipe</span>. A strong,
woody twiner with very large, heavy leaves, forming a dense
screen and having peculiarly shaped flowers. But one
species is considered hardy north, <i>A. Sipho</i>. This will grow
without special treatment and prove a satisfactory ornamental
screen or porch plant. Reaches a height of 20 or 30
ft. Young plants need some protection in cold winters.</p>

<p><b>Artichoke.</b> A tall, coarse perennial of the thistle
tribe, producing flower-heads which are edible. When once
established, it will last in bearing for a number of years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
While this plant is not generally grown in this country,
its merit as a supplementary vegetable for salads or cooking
is great. It is usually grown from suckers from the root,
but a start can be made by sowing the seed. Sow in a
border or seed box and transplant to the garden in early
summer; and the following year a crop may be had. The
parts of the plant used are the flower-heads and the young
suckers, the former boiled or eaten raw as a salad. The young
shoots may be tied together and blanched, using them like
asparagus or Swiss chard. The fleshy scales of the head
and the soft “bottom” of the head are the parts used. But
few of these plants would be needed for a family, as they
produce a number of flower-heads to a plant and a quantity
of suckers. The plants should be set from 2 to 3 ft. apart
in the row, the rows being 3 ft. apart. This vegetable is
not quite hardy in the north, but a covering of leaves or
barnyard litter to the depth of a foot will protect them well.
The plant, being a perennial, will continue to yield for a
number of years under good cultivation. These plants make
no mean decorative subjects, either massed or in a mixed
border, and from the rarity of their culture are always objects
of interest.</p>

<p><b>Artichoke, Jerusalem</b>, is a wholly different
plant from the above, although it is commonly known as
“Artichoke” in this country. It is a species of sunflower
which produces potato-like tubers. These tubers may be
used in lieu of potatoes. They are very palatable to hogs;
and when the plant becomes a weed&mdash;as it often does&mdash;it
may be exterminated by turning the hogs into it. Hardy.</p>

<p><b>Arundo</b>, or <span class="smcap">Reed</span>, is one of the best of bold and
ornamental grasses, excellent for the center of a large formal
bed, or for emphatic points in a mixed border. It is perennial
and hardy in the northern states, but it is advisable
to give it a mulch on the approach of winter. Thrives in
any rich soil, doing best where somewhat moist. 8-12 ft.
The clumps enlarge year by year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<b>Asparagus.</b> A hardy herbaceous perennial,
much grown for the soft, edible, early spring shoots. The
culture of this, the finest of early vegetables, has been simplified
in the past few years, and at present the knowledge
required to successfully plant and grow a good supply need
not be that of a professional. The old method of excavating
to the depth of 3 ft. or more, throwing in from 4 to 6 in.
of broken stone or bricks for drainage, then filling to within
16 to 18 in. of the surface with well rotted manure, with 6
in. of soil upon which to set the roots, has given place to
the simple practice of plowing or digging a trench from 14
to 16 in. deep, spreading well rotted manure in the bottom
to the depth of 3 or 4 in.; when well trodden down covering
the manure with 3 or 4 in. of good garden soil, then setting
the plants, with the roots well spread out, covering carefully
with soil to the level of the garden, and firming the soil
with the feet. This will leave the crowns of the plants from
4 to 5 in. below the surface. In setting, 1-year-old plants
will prove more satisfactory than older ones, being less
liable to suffer from injury to the root system than those
which have made a larger growth. Two years after setting
the crop may be cut, but not sooner if a lasting bed is desired,
as the effort to replace the stalks has a tendency to
weaken the plant unless the roots are well established. The
yearly treatment of an Asparagus bed consists of cleaning
off tops and weeds in the fall and adding a dressing of well
rotted manure to the depth of 3 or 4 in., this manure to be
lightly forked into the bed the following spring; or, the
tops may be allowed to stand for winter protection and the
mulch left off. A top-dressing of nitrate of soda, at the
rate of 200 pounds per acre, is often beneficial as a spring
stimulant, especially in the case of an old bed. Good results
will also follow an application of bone meal or superphosphate
at the rate of from 300 to 500 pounds per
acre. The practice of sowing salt on an Asparagus bed is
almost universal. Still, beds that have never received a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
pound of salt are found to be as productive as those having
received an annual dressing. Nevertheless, a salt dressing
is recommended. In stubborn, heavy soil the best method
to pursue in making a permanent bed would be to throw out
all the dirt from the trench and replace with good, fibrous
loam. Two rows of Asparagus 25 ft. long and 3 ft. apart would
supply a large family with an abundance throughout the
season, and if well taken care of will last a number of years.
Conover’s Colossal is the variety most generally grown,
and is perhaps the most satisfactory sort. Palmetto, a
variety originating at the south, is also very popular. A
newer variety, called Donald White, originating near Elmira,
N. Y., is recommended by the trade.</p>

<p><b>Asperula.</b> Hardy annuals and perennials.
The low-growing Asperula, with its blue or white flowers,
is not as often used as it should be. The profusion of small
flowers and the long season entitle it to a place in low borders.
The flowers have a pleasing fragrance. Asperulas may be
used effectively on rockwork. The common white species, or
Woodruff, grows less than 1 foot. Grown readily from
seeds, and blooms the first year. All Asperulas thrive best
in a rather moist soil.</p>

<p><b>Asters, China.</b> Half-hardy annuals, of easy
culture. The China Aster has been for years a great
favorite in both old-fashioned and modern gardens. With
the improvements in shapes and colors, they are now
the rivals of the chrysanthemum. As early as 1731 single
white and red Asters were grown and described in England,
and by 1845 they are mentioned as being very numerous
in New England. The Germans were, perhaps, the
first to improve the Asters, and the type most admired and
sought fifty years ago was the full-quilled varieties. Now,
however, the informal type replaces the stiff, formal quilled
flowers of that period. Compare the Comet Aster of to-day
with the Asters of even twenty years ago, and note the
looseness of its broad rays, giving an artistic value<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
far beyond the tall, stiff, purple-blue or whites of that
period.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 126px;">
<img src="images/025-asters.jpg" width="126" height="165" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">China Aster</p>
</div>

<p>The early Asters will bloom in August if the seed is
sown in the open early in the season. They are represented
by the Queen of the Market and Queen of Spring,
either of which, if started in a hotbed or window,
will begin to bloom the last of July. The Queen
of the Market is probably the freest of growth,
and with its long stems makes a very desirable
variety for cut-flowers. In fact, in the rich, mellow
soil in which Asters delight, this variety is
likely to have its large flowers on stems so long
and slender that the plants will need stakes.</p>

<p>The Victoria Asters hold a well deserved place
among the leading varieties, and with high culture will
generally lead in size and profusion of bloom, the colors
ranging from white to the darkest blue. The plants are
also well adapted to pot culture. The chrysanthemum-flowered
Asters, both tall and dwarf, are excellent, as are
the Truffaut Perfection and Peony-flowered. The Comet
Asters are amongst the best. The New Branching type is
now in great favor.</p>

<p>The culture of China Asters is easy. For early bloom
the seeds should be sown in March in boxes of light soil and
covered one-quarter of an inch with soil, the soil pressed
down or firmed over them and the boxes placed in a hotbed
or a sunny window and attention given to watering. When
the seedlings are one inch high they should be transplanted
to other boxes, setting the plants 3 inches apart or
put into 2-inch pots. These should be again placed in a
frame and grown along until the ground has become comparatively
warm. The soil will need to be well enriched,
mellow, and if slightly moist under the surface the results
will be all that could be wished. Asters will grow fairly
well on rather light soil, even if not very rich, but the best
results can only be obtained when the highest culture is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
given. If the rust attacks the plants, spray with ammoniacal
carbonate of copper.</p>

<p><b>Aster, Native.</b> Wild Asters are one of the
glories of the American autumn. They grow almost everywhere
in the north and east,&mdash;along roadsides,
in meadows and swales. Their colors
range from pure white to pink, and purple,
and blue. From August until winter closes
in, they are conspicuous features of the landscape,
vying with the goldenrods in form and
color, but surpassing them in color-range.
Most of them are greatly improved when
transferred to the border. They become
more attractive in general habit, and the flowers are usually
more profuse and sometimes larger. They are of the easiest
possible culture. They can be removed to home grounds in
the fall or spring, and, with little care until they are established,
will make most attractive displays of
autumn color. The species are numerous and
much confused, and it is not necessary to make
a list of them here. Because of their free and
careless habit, they are better adapted to
planting in borders than in the formal flower
beds.</p>

<p><b>Aubrietia deltoidea.</b> A very handsome
little trailing hardy perennial, covered
with attractive purple flowers in early spring.
Should be planted in masses for best effect.
Propagated by cuttings or seeds, usually the latter. Excellent
for rockwork and permanent low edgings.</p>

<p><b><a name="auricula" id="auricula"></a>Auricula.</b> A half-hardy perennial of the
Primrose tribe (<i>Primula Auricula</i>), very popular in Europe,
but little grown in this country on account of the hot, dry
summers. In this country usually propagated by seed, as
for Cineraria; but special varieties are perpetuated by offsets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Seeds sown in February or March should give blooming
plants for the next February or March. Keep the
plants cool and moist, and away from the direct sun during
the summer. Gardeners usually grow them in frames.
In the fall, they are potted into 3-inch or 4-inch pots, and
made to bloom either in frames as for violets or in a cool
conservatory or greenhouse. In April, after blooming has
ceased, repot the plants and treat as the previous year.
From the best plants, offsets may be taken and treated the
same as seedlings. As with most annual-blooming perennials,
best results are to be expected with year-old or 2-year-old
plants. Auriculas grow 6-8 in. high. Colors white
and many shades of red and blue.</p>

<p><b>Azaleas</b> are less grown in this country than
in Europe, largely because of our hot, dry summers and
severe winters. There are two common types or classes,&mdash;the
hardy or Ghent Azaleas, and the Indian Azaleas.</p>

<p>Ghent Azaleas thrive in the open along the seacoast as
far north as southern New England. They require a sandy,
peaty soil, and are treated as other shrubs are. The large
flower-buds are liable to injury from the warm suns of late
winter and early spring, and to avoid this injury the plants
are often protected by covers or shades of brush. In the
interior country, little attempt is made to flower Azaleas
permanently in the open, although they may be grown if
carefully tended and well protected. Both Ghent and Indian
Azaleas are excellent pot-plants, for bloom in late
winter and spring. The plants are imported in great numbers
from Europe, and it is better to buy these plants than
to attempt to propagate them. Pot them up in large-sized
pots, keep them cool and backward for a time until they are
established, then take them into a conservatory temperature,
in which carnations and roses thrive. They should be
potted in a soil made of half peat or well decayed mold and
half rich loam; add a little sand. Pot firmly, and be sure
to provide sufficient drainage. Keep off red spider by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
syringing. After blooming, the plants may be thinned by
pruning out the straggling growths, and repotted. Set them
in a frame or in a semi-shaded place during summer, and see
that they make a good growth. The wood should be well
ripened in the fall. After cold weather sets in, keep the
Indian or evergreen kinds half-dormant by setting them in
a cool, dull-lighted cellar or pit, bringing them in when
wanted for bloom. The Ghent or deciduous kinds may be
touched with frost without injury; and they may be stored
in a cellar until wanted.</p>

<p><a name="B" id="B"></a><b>Bachelor’s Button.</b> <a href="#centaurea"><i>Centaurea Cyanus</i></a>
and also <a href="#gomphrena"><i>Gomphrena</i></a>. Sometimes applied
to double-flowered Crowfoots.</p>

<p class="caption">Balloon Vine</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="balloon" id="balloon"></a>Balloon Vine</b>, or <span class="smcap">Cardiospermum</span>. Annual
tender tendril climber of very rapid growth.
Seed should not be planted until the soil becomes
warm. A very pretty effect can be had by allowing
the vine to run over some coarser vine, or into an
evergreen tree. The balloon-like capsules show to
good advantage between the leaves. It is also useful
for covering piles of brush. Grows 8-12 ft. high.
Give a warm, sunny place.</p>

<p><b>Balsams</b>, or <span class="smcap">Impatiens</span>. Tender annuals, producing
both single and double flowers of many colors.
These well known favorites are usually to be found in old-fashioned
gardens. They are very likely to seed themselves,
coming up in unexpected places and flourishing in neglect.
They do best, however, in rich, sandy soil. If the seed is
sown in boxes late in April and the plants transplanted several
times they will be much dwarfer and the flowers much
more double. A stately, though very formal and stiff, effect
may be had by planting a row of Balsams in the rear of a
low border, pinching off all the side shoots as they start and
growing the plant to a single stem. This will become covered
with the large blooms, giving it the appearance of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
perfect column of flowers. Balsams are injured by the
slightest frost. Seeds germinate quickly. Plants should
stand 12-18 in. apart. They grow 18-30 in. high.</p>

<p><b>Bartonia.</b> Hardy annual, with golden yellow,
brilliant flowers. The tall-growing Bartonia (<i>B. aurea</i>)
may be used in a mixed border to good advantage. It is a
bushy plant, reaching 2-3 ft. high. The dwarf kind may
be used as a border plant or in a rock garden, or as an
edging. The fragrance of both tall and dwarf is very pronounced
in the evening. The Bartonias are very easy to
grow in a warm soil and sunny exposure. Their numerous
thread-like, long stamens are very interesting.</p>

<p><b><a name="basket_plants" id="basket_plants"></a>Basket Plants.</b> In order to have a good hanging
basket, it is necessary that some provision be made
to prevent too rapid drying out of the earth. It is customary,
therefore, to line the pot or basket with moss. Open
wire baskets, like a horse muzzle, are often lined with moss
and used for the growing of plants. Prepare the earth by
mixing some well decayed leaf-mold with rich garden loam,
thereby making an earth which will retain moisture. Hang
the basket in a light place, but still not in a direct sunlight;
and, if possible, avoid putting it where it will be exposed to
drying wind. In order to water the basket, it is often advisable
to sink it into a pail or tub of water. Various
plants are well adapted to hanging baskets. Among the
drooping or vine-like kinds are the strawberry geranium,
Kenilworth ivy, maurandya, German ivy, canary-bird flower,
<i>Asparagus Sprengeri</i>, ivy geranium, trailing fuchsia, wandering
Jew, and othonna. Among the erect-growing plants
which produce flowers, <i>Lobelia Erinus</i>, sweet alyssum,
petunias, oxalis, and various geraniums are to be recommended.
Among foliage plants such things as coleus, dusty
miller, begonia, and some geraniums are adaptable.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 172px;">

<p class="caption">Climax basket</p>
</div>

<p><b>Baskets.</b> For the picking and handling of
fruit in the home garden, the common Climax basket, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
various sizes, is the best receptacle. In these baskets the
products may be sold. When the baskets are sent to
market or to a friend, they should be neat and new looking;
therefore keep them in a dry, dark place, as
in an attic or loft, to prevent them from
becoming warped and discolored.</p>

<p><b>Bean.</b> Under the general name of
Bean, many kinds of plants are cultivated.
They are all tender, and the seeds, therefore,
should not be planted until the weather is
thoroughly settled; and the soil should be
warm and loose. They are all annuals in northern countries,
or treated as such.</p>

<p>The Bean plants may be classified in various ways. In
respect to stature, they may be thrown into three general
categories; viz., the pole or climbing Beans, the bush
Beans, and the strict-growing or upright Beans (as the
Broad or Windsor Bean). In respect to their uses, Beans
again may be divided into three categories; viz., those
which are used as string or snap Beans, the entire pod
being eaten; those which are used as shell Beans, the
full-size but immature Beans being shelled from the pod
and cooked; dry Beans, or those which are eaten in their
dry or winter condition. The same variety of Bean may be
used for all of these three purposes at different stages of its
development; but as a matter of fact, there are varieties
which are better for one purpose than the other. Again,
Beans may be classified in respect to their species. Those
species which are best known are as follows: (1) Common
Bean, or <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>, of which there are both
tall and bush forms. All the common snap and string Beans
belong here, as also the Speckled Cranberry types of pole
Beans, and the common field Beans. (2) The Lima Beans,
or <i>Phaseolus lunatus</i>. The larger part of these are pole
Beans, but lately dwarf or bush varieties have appeared.
(3) The Scarlet Runner, <i>Phaseolus multiflorus</i>, of which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Scarlet Runner and White Dutch Runner are familiar examples.
The Scarlet Runner is usually grown as an ornamental
vine, and it is perennial in warm countries, but the
Beans are edible as shelled Beans. The White Dutch
Runner is oftener cultivated for food. (4) The Yard-Long,
or Asparagus Bean, <i>Dolichos sesquipedalis</i>, which produces
long and weak vines and very long, slender pods. The
green pods are eaten, and also the shelled Beans. The
French Yard-Long is the only variety of this type which is
commonly known in this country. This type of Bean is
popular in the Orient. (5) The Broad Beans, of which the
Windsor is the common type. These are much grown in
the Old World for stock feed, and they are sometimes used
for human food. They grow to one strict, central, stiff
stalk, to a height of 2-4 or 5 ft., and they are very unlike
other kinds of Beans in appearance. In this country, they
are very little grown on account of our hot and dry summers.
In Canada they are somewhat grown, and are sometimes
used in the making of ensilage.</p>

<p>The culture of the Bean, while of the easiest, often
proves a failure as far as the first crop is concerned, because
of planting the seed before the ground has become
warm and dry. No vegetable seed will decay quicker than
Beans, and the delay caused by waiting for the soil to become
warm and free from excessive moisture will be more
than made up by the rapidity of growth when finally they
are planted. Beans will grow in most any soil, but the best
results may be obtained by having the soil well enriched
and in good physical condition. From the 5th to the 10th
of May in the latitude of central New York, it will be safe
to plant Beans for an early crop. The Beans may be
dropped 2 inches deep in shallow drills, the seeds to lie 3
inches apart. Cover to the surface of the soil, and if the
ground be dry, firm it with the foot or the back of the hoe.
For the bush varieties, allow 2 ft. between the drill-rows,
but for the dwarf Limas 2½ ft. is better. Pole Limas are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
usually planted in hills 2-3 ft. apart in the rows. Dwarf
Limas may be sown thinly in drills.</p>

<p>A large number of the varieties of both the green-podded
and the wax-podded Beans are used almost exclusively as
snap Beans, to be eaten with the pod while tender. The
various strains of the Black Wax are the most popular
string Beans. The pole or running Beans are used either
green or dried, and the Limas, both tall and dwarf, are
well known for their superior flavor either as shelled or
dry Beans. The old-fashioned Cranberry or Horticultural
Lima type (a pole form of <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) is probably
the best shell Bean, but the trouble of poling makes it
unpopular. Dwarf Limas are much more desirable for
small gardens than the pole varieties, as they may be
planted much closer, the bother of procuring poles and
twine is avoided, and the garden will have a more sightly
appearance. Both the dwarf Limas and pole Limas require
a longer season in which to mature than the bush varieties,
and only one planting is usually made. But the bush varieties
may be planted at intervals of two weeks from the
first planting until the 10th of August. Each planting may
be made on ground previously occupied by some early-maturing
crop. Thus, the first to third plantings may be on
ground from which has been harvested a crop of spinach,
early radish or lettuce; after that, on ground where early
peas have been grown; and the later sowings where beets
or early potatoes have grown. String Beans for canning
are usually taken from the last crop. One quart of seed
will plant 100 ft. of drill; or 1 quart of Limas will plant
100 hills.</p>

<p>Limas are the richest of Beans, but they often fail to
mature in the northern states. The land should not be
very rich in nitrogen (or stable manure), else the plants
will run too much to vine and be too late. Select a fertile
sandy or gravelly soil with warm exposure, use some soluble
commercial fertilizer to start them off, and give them the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
best of culture. Aim to have the pods set before the
droughts of midsummer come. Good trellises for Beans
are made by wool twine stretched between two horizontal
wires, one of which is drawn a foot above the ground and
the other 6 or 7 ft. high.</p>

<p>Bean plants are not troubled by insects to any extent,
but they are sometimes attacked by blight. When this occurs,
do not plant the same ground to Beans again for
a year or two.</p>

<p><b><a name="bedding" id="bedding"></a>Bedding.</b> This term is used to designate the
massing of plants in the open ground for the purpose of
making a bold display of color. This color may be obtained
with flowers or with strong effects of foliage. Bedding is
ordinarily a temporary species of planting; that is, the bed
is filled anew each year. However, the term may be used
to designate a permanent plantation of plants which are
heavily massed so as to give one continuous or emphatic
display of form or color. Some of the best permanent bedding
masses are made of the various hardy ornamental
grasses, as eulalias, arundo, and the like.</p>

<p>Some bedding is very temporary in its effect. Especially
is this true of spring Bedding, in which the plants used are
tulips, hyacinths, crocuses or other early-flowering bulbous
plants. In this case, the ground is usually occupied later in
the season by other plants. These later plants are usually
annuals, the seeds of which are sown amongst the bulbs as
soon as the season is far enough advanced; or the annuals
may be started in boxes and the plants transplanted amongst
the bulbs as soon as the weather is fit. Many of the low-growing
and compact, continuous-flowering annuals are excellent
for summer Bedding effects. Some of the best plants
for this purpose are mentioned in the following list:</p>

<p>Summer bedding is often made by perennial plants which
are carried over from the preceding year, or better, which
are propagated for that particular purpose in February and
March. Such plants as geranium, coleus, alyssum, scarlet
salvia, ageratum and heliotrope may be used for these beds.
It is a common practice to use geranium plants which are in
bloom during the winter for bedding out during the summer,
but such plants are tall and ungainly in form and have
expended the greater part of their energies. It is better to
propagate new plants by taking cuttings or slips late in the
winter and setting out young, fresh, vigorous subjects.</p>

<p>Very bold and subtropical effects can be made by planting
in the open such things as palms, bananas, crotons,
araucarias, caladiums and cannas. Plants like bananas and
palms, which are kept normally in pots, would better be left
in the pots and plunged to the rims rather than turned out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
directly into the soil. In order to attain quick and continuous
effects, it is advisable to set the plants rather close.
As such plants are likely to be injured by strong winds, it
is well to have subtropical beds in a somewhat protected
place.</p>

<p>Another type of bed is that which attempts to make
patterns or designs, or carpet-bedding. There are comparatively
few plants which are adapted to this purpose,
for the plants must be such as will stand shearing and which
have very strong and constant colors of foliage. The most
popular bedding plants are coleus (particularly the yellow
Golden Bedder) achyranthes, alternanthera, <i>Centaurea
gymnocarpa</i>, and such succulent plants as the house leeks.
Some of the annual flowers may also be used for strong
color effects, as <i>Lobelia Erinus</i> and sweet alyssum. Ordinarily
the making of carpet-beds should be left to professional
gardeners, since it requires much skill and care to
make and keep the beds in perfect condition; and a ragged
or imperfect carpet-bed is worse than no bed at all. Carpet-beds
are really curiosities, and they have no more legitimate
place in the general pictorial landscape design area than
painted stones or sheared evergreens. Therefore, they
should be placed by themselves at one side, where they do not
interfere with the general design of the place. In public
parks they make a very useful attraction when set off by
themselves, the same as zoölogical gardens or other attractions
do.</p>

<p><b>Beefsteak Geranium</b> is <a href="#begonias"><i>Begonia</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Beets.</b> Being one of the hardiest of spring
vegetables, the seed may be sown as early in the spring as
the ground can be worked. A light, sandy soil is the best
on which to grow Beets to perfection, but any well tilled
garden soil will raise satisfactory crops. On heavy soil the
turnip Beet gives the best results, as the growth is nearly
all at or above the surface. The long varieties, having
tapering roots running deep into the soil, are apt to be misshapen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
unless the physical condition of the soil is such that
the roots meet with little obstruction. A succession of sowings
should be made, at intervals of from two to three weeks,
until late summer, as the Beets are much more desirable
in their young stage than when they have become old and
woody. The Mangel-Wurzel and the Sugar Beet are usually
grown as a field crop, and will not enter into the calculations
of the home garden.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 138px;">
<img src="images/037-beets.jpg" width="138" height="245" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Early Beets</p>
</div>

<p>In order to hasten the season of the extra-early crop of
Beets, the seeds may be sown in boxes or in the soil of a
hotbed in February or March, transplanting the small plants
to the open ground at the time the first sowing of seed is
made. As the flat or turnip-rooted varieties grow at the
surface of the ground, the seed may be sown thickly, and as
the more advanced roots are large enough to use they may
be pulled, leaving room for the later ones to develop, thus
growing a quantity in a small area and having a long season
of small Beets from one sowing. For winter use
the late July sown seed will give the best roots,
growing through the cool months of the fall to a
medium size and remaining firm without being
tough or stringy. These may be dug up after
light frosts and before any severe cold weather,
and stored in barrels or boxes in the cellar, using
enough dry dirt to fill spaces between the roots
and cover them to the depth of 6 inches. These
roots, thus packed in a cool cellar, will be fit to
use through the entire winter months. When it
can be had, florists’ or sphagnum moss is an excellent
medium in which to pack roots for winter.</p>

<p>The early round or turnip varieties are best for early and
summer use. The Long Blood Beets may be used for storing,
but these require a longer season of growth.</p>

<p><b><a name="begonias" id="begonias"></a>Begonias.</b> Tender bedding and house plants.
Next to the geranium, Begonias are probably the most popular
for house culture of the entire plant list. The ease of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
culture, profusion of bloom or richness of foliage, together
with their adaptability to shade, make them very desirable.</p>

<p>Begonias may be divided into three sections: the fibrous-rooted
class, which contains the winter-flowering varieties;
the tuberous-rooted, those which
bloom through the summer, the
tuber resting through the winter;
and the Rex forms, or Beefsteak
Geraniums, having large ornamental
leaves.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/038-begonia.jpg" width="245" height="220" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Fibrous-rooted Begonia</p>
</div>

<p>The fibrous-rooted kinds may be
propagated by seed or cuttings, the
latter being the usual method. Cuttings
of half-ripened wood root easily,
making a rapid growth, the
plants flowering in a few months.</p>

<p>The tuberous-rooted varieties are propagated by division
of the tuber or from seed, the former being rarely done except
to increase the stock of some extra fine variety. The
seeds, like those of all Begonias, are very small, and
should be sown with great care. Simply sprinkle them on
the surface of the soil, which should be a mixture of leaf-mold
and sand, with the addition of a small amount of fibrous
loam. Watering should be done by setting the pot or box
in which the seeds are sown in water, allowing the moisture
to ascend through the soil. When the soil has become completely
saturated, set the box in a shady situation, covering
it with glass or some other object until the tiny seedlings
appear. Never allow the soil to become dry. The seedlings
should be transplanted, as soon as they can be handled, into
boxes or pots containing the same mixture of soil, setting
each plant down to the seed-leaf. They will need three or
four transplantings before they reach the blooming stage,
and at each one after the first, the amount of fibrous loam
may be increased until the soil is composed of one-third
each of loam, sand and leaf-mold. The addition of a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
well rotted manure may be made at the last transplanting.
These tuberous-rooted Begonias make superior bedding
plants if given a shady situation and deep soil; but for the
amateur they are perhaps better grown as pot-plants, for
one is able to give them better conditions by that method.
The flowers are both double and single,
ranging in color from pure white and yellow
to pink and red. After flowering the plants
will die down and the tubers, after drying
off, may be placed in a dry, warm place
until spring.</p>

<p class="caption">Rex Begonia</p>
</div>

<p>The Rex type, having no branches, is
propagated from the leaves. The large mature
leaves are used. The leaf may be cut
into sections having at the base a union of
two ribs. These pieces of leaves may be inserted in the sand
as any other cutting. Or a whole leaf may be used, cutting
through the ribs at intervals and laying the leaf flat on the
propagating bench or other warm, moist place. In a short
time young plants having roots of their own will form.
These may be potted when large enough to handle, and will
soon make good sized plants. Rex Begonias usually grow
little during winter. Be sure that the pots are well drained,
so that the soil does not become sour. New plants&mdash;those
a year or so old&mdash;are usually most satisfactory. Keep them
away from direct sunlight.</p>

<p>An insidious disease of Begonia leaves has recently made
its appearance. The best treatment yet known is to propagate
fresh plants, throwing away the old stock
and the dirt in which it is grown.</p>

season. It is usually found best to plant in the fall,
earthing up slightly around the plants. The distance between
the plants should be regulated by the variety. The
smaller-growing kinds (as Early Harvest and Wilson) may
be planted 4 x 7 ft., the rank-growing varieties
(as Snyder) 6 x 8 ft. Thorough cultivation
throughout the season will help in a material
degree to hold the moisture necessary to perfect
a good crop. The soil should be cultivated
very shallow, however, so as not to disturb
the roots, as the breaking of the roots
starts a large number of suckers that have to
be cut out and destroyed.</p>

<p>Blackberries, like dewberries and raspberries,
bear but one crop on the cane. That is,
canes which spring up this year bear next year.
From 3 to 6 canes are sufficient to be left in each
hill. The superfluous ones are thinned out soon
after they start from the ground. The old canes
should be cut out soon after fruiting and burned.
The new shoots should be pinched back at the
height of 2 or 3 ft. if the plants are to support
themselves. If to be fastened to wires, they may
be allowed to grow throughout the season and be
cut back when tied to the wires in winter or early
spring. Tools for the cutting out of the old canes
are well represented in the pictures. Shears are used

<b><a name="bordeaux" id="bordeaux"></a>Bordeaux Mixture</b> is a fungicide, used to combat
mildews, leaf-diseases, blights, etc. It is sprayed on
the plants with a spray pump or syringe, or it may be applied
with a whisk broom. Apply enough of it so that the
foliage looks blue. It is made as follows: Copper sulfate,
6 pounds; quicklime, 4 pounds; water, 40 to 50 gallons.
Dissolve the copper sulfate by putting it into a bag of coarse
cloth and hanging this in a vessel holding at least four gallons,
so that it is just covered by the water. Use an
earthen or wooden vessel. Slake the lime in an equal
amount of water. Then mix the two and add enough
water to make 40 gallons. It is then ready for immediate
use, but will keep for some time. If the mixture
is to be used on peach foliage, it is advisable to add an
extra pound of lime to the above formula. When applied
to such plants as carnations or cabbages, it will
adhere better if a pound of hard soap is dissolved in
hot water and added to the mixture. For rots, molds,
mildews, and all fungous diseases.</p>

<p>Whilst Bordeaux Mixture is the best general fungicide,
it discolors the plants until it washes off. On ornamental
plants, therefore, a colorless fungicide may be preferable.
In such cases, use the ammoniacal carbonate of copper
solution, as follows: Copper carbonate, 1 ounce; ammonia,
1 volume 26° Baumé, ⅞ volumes water (enough to dissolve
the copper); water, 9 gallons. The copper carbonate is best
dissolved in large bottles, where it will keep indefinitely,
and it should be diluted with water as required. For the
same purposes as Bordeaux Mixture.</p>

<p><b><a name="border" id="border"></a>Border.</b> The word border is used to designate
the heavy or continuous planting about the boundaries of a
place, or along the walks and drives, or against the buildings,
in distinction from planting on the lawn or in the interior
spaces. A border receives different designations,
depending upon the kinds of plants which are grown
therein; that is, it may be a shrub border, a flower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
border, a hardy border for native and other hardy plants,
a vine border, and the like. As a rule, the most effective
planting is that which is thrown into masses, for one plant
reinforces the other, and the flowers have a good setting
or background. Very striking displays of foliage and flowers
and plant forms can be made when massed together. As a
rule, plants are more easily grown when planted in a border,
since the whole area can be kept cultivated with ease; and
if a plant becomes weak or dies, its place is readily filled
by the neighboring plants spreading into it. Planting in
masses is also essential to the best arrangement of the
yard, since the basis of any landscape is
a more or less continuous greensward (<a href="#lawns">see
<i>Lawn</i></a>). The house occupies the central
part of the area, and the sides are heavily
massed or planted so as to make a framework
for the whole place. The border
may be mixed,&mdash;that is, composed of a great
variety of plants,&mdash;or it may be made up of
one continuous thing. In long and very
striking borders, it is often best to have the
background&mdash;that is, the back row&mdash;of one general type of
plant in order to give continuity and strength to the whole
group. In front of this a variety of plants may be set, if
one desire.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 184px;">
<img src="images/042-steps.jpg" width="184" height="177" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Planting by the steps</p>
</div>

<p>The land should be rich. The whole ground should be
plowed or spaded and the plants set irregularly in the
space; or the back row may be set in a line. If the border
is composed of shrubs, and is large, a horse cultivator may
be run in and out between the plants for the first two or
three years, since the shrubs will be set from 2 to 4 ft.
apart. Ordinarily, however, the cultivating is done by hand
tools. After the plants are once established and the border
is filled, it is best to dig up as little as possible, for the
digging disturbs the roots and breaks off the crowns. It is
usually best to pull out the weeds and give the border a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
top-dressing each fall of well rotted manure. If the ground
is not very rich, a sprinkling of ashes or some commercial
fertilizer may be given from time to time. The border
should be planted so thick as to allow the plants to run
together, thereby giving one continuous effect. Most
shrubs should be set 3 feet apart. Things as large as
lilacs may go 4 feet and sometimes even more. Common
herbaceous perennials, like bleeding heart, delphiniums,
hollyhocks, and the like, should go from 12 to 18 inches.
On the front edge of the border is a very excellent
place for annual and tender flowering plants. Here,
for example, one may make a fringe of asters, geraniums,
coleus, or anything else which he may choose (<a href="#flower_beds">see
<i>Flower Beds</i></a>).</p>

<p>The border is an excellent place in which to colonize
native or other interesting plants. A person comes across
an attractive plant on his tramp and wishes it were in his
garden. Whatever the time of year, he may break off the
top close to the ground, take up the roots and plant them
in the border. If a little attention is given to the plant for
the first two or three weeks, as watering or mulching or
shading, it should become established and give satisfactory
bloom the following year. Two-thirds of the herbs
which one would take up in this way, even in midsummer,
should grow. Into the heavy borders about the boundaries
of the place the autumn leaves will drift and afford an excellent
mulch. If these borders are planted with shrubs,
the leaves may be left there to decay, and not be raked off in
the spring. The general outline of the border facing the
lawn should be more or less wavy or irregular, particularly
if it is on the boundary of the place. Alongside a walk or
drive, the margins may follow the general directions of the
walk or drive.</p>

<p>There are three rules for the choosing of plants for a
hardy border. Choose (1) those which you like best, (2)
those which are adapted to the climate and soil, (3) those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which are in place or in keeping with that part of the
grounds. See <a href="#herbs"><i>Herbs</i></a>, <a href="#shrub"><i>Shrubs</i></a>, <a href="#trees"><i>Trees</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Borecole</b> is <a href="#kale"><i>Kale</i></a>.</p>

<p><b><a name="borers" id="borers"></a>Borers.</b> There is no sovereign remedy for
borers except to dig them out. Do not rely upon washes or
other applications. If trees are examined two or three
times a year, it is not a laborious undertaking to dig them
out, as they will not be deep in the wood. If they do get
deep in the wood, thrust a wire into the burrow. By the
chips cast from the holes, or by the dead bark, the presence
of borers may be detected. Apple and peach trees are particularly
liable to attack. The flat-headed apple-tree borer
works just underneath the bark on any part of the trunk or
large branches. The round-headed apple-tree borer eats
into the wood at the crown.</p>

<p><b>Boxes</b> of many sizes can be utilized in which
to grow plants. Excellent effects of bulbs and annuals may
be had in old soap boxes. The boxes may be placed in
the best situations for the growth of the plants, and they
can receive better attention than the large flower bed.
Vines planted about the edge will hide the sides,&mdash;such
vines as Kenilworth ivy, moneywort, maurandya, trailing
fuchsia, and the like.</p>

<p><b>Broccoli.</b> This is almost identical with the
Cauliflower, except that it usually requires a longer season
and matures in the fall. It is grown more generally in
Europe than in this country. The special merit of Broccoli
is its adaptability for late summer planting and its
rapid growth in the late fall. It is said that a large
proportion of Broccoli is used in the manufacture of
pickles. The culture is the same as for Cauliflower,&mdash;deep,
moist soil well enriched, cool weather, and the destruction
of the cabbage worm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
The young plants may be grown in a coldframe or in a
well protected border, sowing the seed about the 15th of
May, transplanting into rows in July. In sections in which
early fall frosts are not to be feared, the plants may be set
two weeks later, say August 1, as all vegetables of the
cabbage family make the best growth through the cool
months of September and October. The plants should be
set 18 in. apart in the rows, the rows being from 2½ ft. to 3
ft. apart.</p>

<p><b><a name="browallia" id="browallia"></a>Browallia elata</b> is a very fine tender annual,
giving a border or mixed bed a dash of amethyst blue not
often found in flowers. It is a strong-growing plant with a
profusion of bloom, and no doubt one of the choicest plants
of its color in cultivation. There are other species with
white flowers that serve as contrast, and may be grown
with this. All of the kinds may be taken up and potted
in the fall, cutting the plant well back, and a profusion
of bloom may be obtained through the winter months if
attention is given to pinching off the seed pods. In the
garden, let the plants stand 12 in. apart. The plants grow
1-2 ft. high.</p>

<p><b>Brussels Sprouts.</b> This is a vegetable that
should be more generally known, as it is one of the
choicest of the cabbage family, and may be had at its
best after the season for cauliflower has passed. It is
the better for being touched by the fall frosts. The
parts used are the buttons or sprouts (miniature cabbage
heads) that grow thickly along the stem. These should
be cut off rather than broken. The very small hard
“sprouts” or buttons are the best. The culture is essentially
the same as for late cabbage or broccoli. One ounce
will sow 100 ft. of drill, or make upward of 2,000 plants.
Set plants in field 2-3 ft. apart. They require the entire
season in which to grow.</p>

<p><b>Budding.</b> <a href="#grafting">See <i>Grafting</i>.</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<b><a name="bulbs" id="bulbs"></a>Bulbs.</b> The outdoor culture of bulbs is extremely
simple. They care for themselves throughout a
greater part of the year, many of them flowering when no
other plants are able to grow and bloom out of doors.</p>

<p>While all the so-called Holland bulbs will thrive in any
kind of soil, they will all do better by being planted in a
deep, sandy soil well enriched with well rotted manure.
But do not let the manure come into direct contact with the
bulb. Even heavy clay soil may be fitted for the growing of
bulbs by the addition of sharp sand, either worked into the
soil or placed directly under the bulb when planted. To
make a bulb bed, choose, if possible, a sandy soil and throw
out the top soil to the depth of 6 in. Put into the bottom
of the bed about 2 in. of well rotted manure and spade it
into the soil. Throw back half of the top soil, level it off
nicely, set the bulbs firmly on this bed and then cover them
with the balance of the soil; in this way one will have the
bulbs from 3 to 4 in. below the surface. In the fall months
the top of the ground is cooler than at the depth of 5 or 6
in. and the top of the bulb will not want to grow, while the
bottom, which is always in a hurry, will send out roots,
to push out the leaves and flowers the next spring. When
the weather is cold enough to freeze a hard crust on the
soil, the bed should have its winter overcoat. This may be
straw, hay, cornstalks or leaves spread over the bed to the
depth of 6 in. if the material is coarse; but if leaves
are used, 3 in. will be enough, because the leaves lay close
together and may smother out the frost that is in the
ground and let the bulbs start. What we want is to keep
them asleep until spring, because if they start too early the
hard freezes of March and early April will spoil their beauty
if the leaves or flowers are near or above the surface.
Early in April, in New York, the covering may be removed
gradually, and should all be off the beds before the leaves
show above the ground.</p>

<p>If there is no sandy place for the beds, make them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as directed, leaving the stones in the bottom of the bed
for drainage. Then, when ready to set the bulb, place
a large handful of sand where the bulb is to go and set the
bulb on it. This will keep the water from standing around
the bulb. Very fine results may be had on heavy soil by
this method.</p>

<p>As to kinds of bulbs, select hyacinths, tulips or narcissus
or daffodils, with snowdrops or crocuses of various
colors around the edge. For the culture of these and other
bulbs, see the various articles throughout the book.</p>

<p><i>The growing of flowering bulbs through the winter</i> adds
to the list of house plants a charming variety. The labor,
time and skill required is much less than that of growing
many of the larger plants more commonly used for winter
decorations. The larger number of winter bulbs may
be left out of doors until within four to six weeks of the
time when they are wanted in flower. Hyacinths, narcissus,
tulips, and crocus can be made to flower in the winter
without difficulty. Secure the bulbs so as to be able to pot
them by the middle or last of October, or if earlier all the
better. The soil should be rich, sandy loam, if possible; if
not, the best one can get, to which add about one-fourth
the bulk of sand and mix thoroughly. If ordinary flower
pots are to be used, put in the bottom a few pieces of
broken pots, charcoal or small stones for drainage, then fill
the pot with dirt so that when the bulbs are set on the dirt
the top of the bulb is even with the rim of the pot. Fill
around it with soil, leaving just the tip of the bulb showing
above the dirt. If the soil is heavy, a good plan is to
sprinkle a small handful of sand under the bulb to carry off
the water, the same as is done in the beds outdoors. If one
does not have pots he may use boxes. Starch boxes are a
good size to use, as they are not heavy to handle; and excellent
flowers are sometimes obtained from bulbs planted
in old tomato cans. If boxes or cans are used, care must
be taken to have holes in the bottoms to let the water run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
out. A large size hyacinth bulb will do well in a 5-inch
pot. The same size pot will do for three or four narcissuses
or eight to twelve crocuses.</p>

<p>After the bulbs are planted in the pots or other receptacles,
they should be placed in a cool place, either in a
cold pit or cellar, or on the shady side of a building, or,
better yet, plunged or buried up to the rim of the pot in a
shady border. This is done to force the roots to grow
while the top stands still; as only the bulbs with good roots
will give good flowers. When the weather gets so cold that
a crust is frozen on the soil, the pots should be covered
with a little straw, and as the weather gets colder more
straw must be used. In from six to eight weeks after
planting the bulbs, they should have made roots enough to
grow the plant, and they may be taken up and placed in a
cool room for a week or so, after which, if they have
started into growth, they may be taken into a warmer room
where they can have plenty of light. They will grow very
rapidly now and will want lots of water, and after the
flowers begin to show, the pots may stand in a saucer of
water all the time. When just coming into bloom the
plants may have full sunlight part of the time to help
bring out the color of the flowers.</p>

<p><a name="C" id="C"></a><b>Cabbage.</b> For an early crop, the plants must be
started either in February or early March, or the previous
September and wintered over in coldframes. This latter
method was once a common practice by gardeners near large
cities, but the building of greenhouses to replace the many
hotbeds of the market-gardener has changed the practice
in many localities, and now most of the early Cabbages
in the north are grown from seed sown in January, February
or March. The plants are hardened off in March and
early April and planted out as early as possible. The private
grower, or one with a small garden, may often procure
his early plants from the market-gardener much cheaper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
than he can grow them, as usually only a limited number of
early Cabbage plants are wanted; but for the midseason and
main crop, the seed may be sown in May or June, setting
the plants in July.</p>

<p>For early planting, the number of varieties is limited to
three or four. For an intermediate crop the list is more
extended, and the late varieties are very numerous. The
early list is headed by the Jersey Wakefield, a variety which
heads very quickly, and, although not one of the solid
kinds, is generally grown. The Early
York and Winnigstadt are good varieties
to follow it. The latter especially
is solid and of very good quality. For
the midseason, the Succession and All
Season are of the best, and for the winter
supply the Drumhead, Danish Ball
and Flat Dutch types are the leaders.
One of the best of the Cabbages for
table use is seldom seen in the garden&mdash;the Savoy Cabbage.
It is a type with netted leaves, making a large, low-growing
head, the center of which is very solid and of excellent
flavor, especially late in the fall, when the heads have had
a slight touch of frost. Savoy should be grown in every
private garden.</p>

<p>The seed-bed should be made mellow and rich. A good
border will do. The seed is sown preferably in rows, thus
allowing thinning of the plants and the pulling of any
weeds that germinate. The young plants will well repay
attention to watering and thinning. The rows should be 3
or 4 in. apart. When the plants are large enough to transplant,
they may be planted where early vegetables have
been grown. Set the plants from 18 to 24 in. apart in the
row, the rows being 3 ft. apart for the medium-growing
kinds. One ounce of seed will furnish about two thousand
plants. All Cabbages require deep and rich soil, and one
that holds moisture well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The best remedy for the Cabbage worm is to kill the
first brood on the very young plants with Paris green.
After the plants begin to head, pyrethrum or salt water
may be used. On a small area, hand-picking may be
recommended.</p>

<p>The maggot is the most serious Cabbage pest. After
studying the seventy odd remedies proposed, Slingerland
concludes that 6 are efficient and practicable: growing the
young plants in closely covered frames; tarred paper cards
placed snugly about the base of the plants to keep the fly
away; rubbing the eggs from the base of the plant; hand-picking
of the maggots; treating the plants with emulsion
of carbolic acid; treating them with carbon bisulfide. The
insecticidal materials are injected or poured into the soil
about the base of the plant.</p>

<p>Respecting these two insecticides, Slingerland remarks:
“Always use the crude carbolic acid, as it is much cheaper
than the purified and is nearly, if not quite, as effective.
It will probably be safer if used as an emulsion than if
simply diluted with water. We would advise that it be
made by the follow formula: 1 pound of hard soap or 1
quart of soft soap dissolved in 1 gallon of boiling water, into
which 1 pint of crude carbolic acid is then poured and the
whole mass agitated into an emulsion, which will remain in
this condition for a long time. In treating the plants, take
one part of this standard emulsion and dilute it with 30
equal parts of water; it probably can be used stronger without
injury to the plants. If the emulsion is cold and semi-solid,
use several parts of warm water at first. Begin the
treatment early, a day or two after the plants are up, or in
the case of Cabbages and Cauliflowers the next day after
they are set in the field, and repeat it once each week or 10
days until about May 20 in our state. While we have little
faith in the preventive effects of the early treatments, we do
believe that the emulsion will then kill many of the eggs
and recently hatched maggots. If it could be applied with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
some force through a syringe or force pump, it might not be
necessary to go to the trouble of first removing some of the
earth from about the plants. It must be remembered that
its success will depend on the eggs or maggots being hit
with it. None of the Cabbages in our experiment were injured
in the least by an application containing nearly twice
as much of the acid, and there is but little danger of its
injuring the tenderest foliage of radishes, turnips or onions;
if any injury manifests itself on these crops, dilute the
emulsion with 40 or 50 or more parts of water, instead of 30.
A knapsack or wheelbarrow sprayer would prove a very useful
instrument in applying the emulsion on a large scale.”</p>

<p>The carbon bisulfide is best injected into the soil by
means of a long-nosed syringe. Slingerland (Cornell Bulletin
78) illustrates a specially made syringe or injector for this
purpose: “Thus Cabbage plants can be treated once, and
once is usually sufficient, at the rate of about 10 plants for
1 cent for the liquid, using about 1 teaspoonful to each
plant. As the injector will last for years, and several
neighbors might join in the purchase and use of one instrument,
its cost would practically not influence this estimate
of the cost of killing the maggots. We believe it is the
cheapest, most effective, and most practicable method yet
devised for fighting this pest on crops of Cabbages and
cauliflowers; on crops of radishes, turnips, or onions it will
probably be too expensive except where choice or new varieties
are attacked. The carbolic acid emulsion will prove
the most practicable on these last crops.”</p>

<p>The club-root, which causes the roots to become greatly
thickened and distorted, is difficult to manage if Cabbages
or allied plants are grown continuously on land in which
diseased plants have been raised. Changing the location
of the Cabbage or Cauliflower patch is the best procedure.
If very different crops, as corn, potatoes, peas, tomatoes,
etc., are grown on the land, the disease will be starved out
in two or three years.</p>

<b>Cacalia.</b> <span class="smcap">Tassel Flower. Ladies’ Paint
Brush.</span> A quaint old annual, in two colors, scarlet and
orange. It is easily grown, and makes a fine second-row
plant for a border, contrasting well with Browallia or Ageratum.
Sow where the plants are to stand. Let plants stand
10-12 inches apart. Grow 1½-2 ft. high.</p>

<p><b><a name="cactus" id="cactus"></a>Cactus.</b> This class of plants is often seen in
small collections of house plants, to which they add interest,
being altogether different from other plants. All
Cacti are easy to grow, requiring but little care and enduring
the heat and dryness of a living room much better than
most other plants. Their requirements are ample drainage
and a sandy soil. Cactus growers usually make a soil by
mixing pulverized plaster or lime refuse with garden
loam, using about two-thirds of the loam. The very fine
parts, or dust, of the plaster, are blown out, else the soil
is likely to cement. They may be rested at any season by
simply setting them away in a dry place for two or three
months, and bringing them into heat and light when they
are wanted. As new growth advances they should have
water occasionally, and when in bloom they should be
watered freely. Withhold water gradually after blooming
until they are to be rested.</p>

<p>Some of the most common species in cultivation are the
Phyllocactus species, often called the Night-blooming Cereus.
These are not the true Night-blooming Cereuses, which have
angular or cylindrical stems, covered with bristles, while
this has flat, leaf-like branches; the flowers of these, however,
are very much like the Cereus, opening at evening
and closing before morning, and as the Phyllocacti may be
grown with greater ease, blooming on smaller and younger
plants, they are to be recommended. <a href="#cereus">See <i>Cereus</i>.</a></p>

<p>The Epiphyllum, or Lobster Cactus, is one of the best
of the family, easy of culture. It bears bright-colored
blossoms at the end of each joint. When in flower, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
will be through some of the winter months, this requires a
richer soil than the other Cacti. Opuntias, or prickly pears,
are often grown as border plants through the summer. In
fact, all the family may be planted out, and if a number of
varieties are set in a bed together they make a striking addition
to the garden. Be very careful not to bruise the
plants. It is better to plunge them in the pots than to turn
them out of the pots.</p>

<p class="caption">Caladium or Colocasia</p>
</div>

<p><b>Caladium.</b> Tuberous-rooted, tender perennial
plants which are used for conservatory decorations, and
also for subtropical and bold effects in the lawn. The
plants which are commonly known under this name are
really Colocasias. The plants should be rested during the
winter, being kept in a warm cellar or under a greenhouse
bench, where they are not liable to frost or dampness. The
roots are usually kept covered with earth during the winter,
but they are kept dry. Early in the spring
the roots are put into boxes or pots and are
started into growth, so that by the time
settled weather comes they will be 1 or 2
feet high and ready to set directly into soil.
When set out of doors, they should be given
a place which is protected from strong
winds, and one which does not receive the
full glare of direct sunlight. The soil
should be rich and deep, and the plants
should have an abundance of water. Caladiums
are most excellent plants for striking effects, especially
against a house, high shrubbery or other background.
If they are planted by themselves, they should be in clumps
rather than scattered as single specimens, as the effect is
better. See that they get a good start before they are
planted in the open ground.</p>

<p><b>Calceolaria.</b> Small greenhouse herbs which
are sometimes used in the window-garden. They are not
very satisfactory plants for window treatment, however, since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
they suffer from dry atmosphere and from sudden changes
of temperature. In the window-garden they should be protected
from strong, direct sunlight. They are grown from
seeds. If the seeds are sown in early summer and the
young plants are transplanted as they need, flowering
specimens may be had for the late fall and early winter. In
the growing of the young plants, always avoid exposing
them to direct sunlight; but they should be given a place
which has an abundance of screened or tempered light. A
new crop of plants should be raised each year. There is a
race of shrubby Calceolarias, but it is little known in this
country. One or two species are annuals which are adaptable
to cultivation in the open garden, and their little,
ladyslipper-like flowers are attractive. However, they are
of secondary importance as annual garden flowers.</p>

<p><b>Calendula.</b> These are the well known <span class="smcap">Pot
Marigolds</span>, and add a bright spot to any garden. Annual.
Especially are they fine in the cool days of the fall, when
many of the annual flowers have gone to seed. The places
of short-lived plants may be filled by sowing seed of Calendulas
in May, scattering them through the border and
allowing the plants to grow where they come up. Easy of
growth and hardy. 1-2 ft. high. Should stand 8-12 in.
apart. Colors, yellow and orange.</p>

<p><b><a name="california_poppy" id="california_poppy"></a>California Poppy</b> (<i>Eschscholtzia Californica</i>).
Low perennial, poppy-like plant, grown as a hardy annual.
It is certainly one of the best low-growing annuals, blooming
through a long season and being at its
best through the cool days of fall, after
touched by frost. Most of the varieties have
flowers of fine shades of orange or yellow,
making a bright spot in the border at all
times. They are like the pot marigolds, in
that once planted they seed themselves.
They are never out of place, and should be left to bloom
wherever they may be. Flowers open only in sunshine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
As cut-flowers they are excellent, a large bowl of them glowing
like a golden ball, especially if they are emphasized by
a few blue larkspurs or bachelor’s buttons.</p>

<p>Propagated by seed, which would best be sown as soon
as ripe, thus giving the plant an early start, and having
bloom through the season. They make attractive mats of
foliage. 12-18 in. high. Let the plants stand 10-20 in.
apart.</p>

<p><b>Calla</b> (properly <i>Richardia</i>). <span class="smcap">Egyptian Lily.</span>
All things considered, this is one of the most satisfactory of
winter house plants, lending itself to various conditions.
The requirements of the Calla are rich soil and an abundance
of water, with the roots confined in as small a space
as possible. If a too large pot is used the growth of foliage
will be very rank, at the expense of the flowers, but by using
a smaller sized pot and applying liquid manure the flowers
will be produced freely. A 6-inch pot will be large enough
for all but an exceptionally large bulb. If desired, a number
of bulbs may be grown together in a larger pot. The soil
should be very rich but fibrous&mdash;at least one-third well
rotted manure will be none too much, mixed with equal
parts of fibrous loam and sharp sand. The tubers should be
planted firmly and the pots set in a cool place to make roots.
After the roots have partially filled the pot, the plant may
be brought into heat and given a sunny position and an
abundance of water. An occasional sponging or washing of
the leaves will free them from dust. No other treatment
will be required until the flowers appear, when liquid manure
may be given. The plant will thrive all the better at
this time if the pot is placed in a saucer of water. In fact,
the Calla will grow finely in an aquarium. The Calla may
be grown through the entire year, but it will prove more
satisfactory, both in leaf and flower, if rested through part
of the summer. This may be done by laying the pots on
their sides in a dry, shady place under shrubbery, or if in
the open slightly covered with straw or other litter to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the roots from becoming extremely dry. In September or
October they may be shaken out, cleaning off all the old soil,
and repotted, as already mentioned. The offsets may be
taken off and set in small pots and given a year’s growth,
resting them the second year and having them in flower that
winter.</p>

<p>The spotted Calla has variegated foliage and is a fine
plant for mixed collections. This blooms in the spring,
which will lengthen the season of Calla bloom. The treatment
of this is similar to that of the common Calla.</p>

<p><b>Callirrhoë.</b> <i>C. pedata</i> is a hardy annual which
has large, graceful blossoms of violet or red. Is it a very
free-blooming plant. Should be started in a frame and
planted out where wanted. 2-3 ft. high and grows bushy.
Plants should stand 1½-2 ft. apart.</p>

<p><b>Camellia.</b> Years ago Camellias were very popular,
but they have been crowded out by the informal flowers
of recent times. Their time will come again. They are
half-hardy woody plants, blooming in late winter and
spring. During the blooming season keep them cool&mdash;say
not over 50° at night and a little higher by day.
When blooming is done they begin to grow, then give
them more heat and plenty of water. See that they are
well ripened by winter. Always screen them from direct
sunlight. Do not try to force them in early winter, after
the growth has ceased. Their summer quarters may be in
a protected place in the open air. Propagated by cuttings
in winter, which should give blooming plants in two
years. Use a porous soil for Camellias, with considerable
leaf-mold.</p>

<p class="caption">Canna</p>
</div>

<p><b>Canna</b> is now the favorite bedding plant. The
improvements made in the past ten years, in size and
markings of the flowers, have created a liking for the plant.
The tropical effect of a large bed of Cannas, either mixed
or of one color, is not surpassed by any other plant used for
bedding purposes.</p>

<p>The Canna may be grown from seed and had in bloom
the first year by sowing in February or March, in
boxes or pots placed in hotbeds or warmhouse, first
soaking the seeds in warm water for a short time. Attention
to transplanting as needed and removal to the ground
only when it is well warmed are the necessary requirements.
The majority of Cannas, however, are grown from pieces of
the roots (rhizomes), each piece having a bud. The roots
may be divided at any time in the winter, and if early
flowers and foliage are wanted the pieces may be planted in
a hotbed or warmhouse in early April, started into growth
and planted out where wanted as soon as the ground has
warmed and all danger of frost is over. A hardening of the
plants, by leaving the sash off the hotbeds, or setting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
plants in shallow boxes and placing the boxes in a sheltered
position through May, not forgetting a liberal supply
of water, will fit the plants to take kindly to the
final planting out. After frost has injured the tops,
the roots may be dug, choosing, if possible, a dry
day. The soil is shaken off and the roots stored
in a warm, dry place through the winter. If the
cellar is too dry the roots are liable to shrivel,
in which case it would be best to cover them with
soil or sand, filling in around the roots to exclude
the drying air.</p>

<p>Cannas grow 3 to 7 ft. high. For dense mass
effects, plant 12-18 in. apart. For individual plants,
or for best bloom, give more room. Fine clumps
may be had by planting out the entire old root, not
dividing it. Cannas want a rich, warm soil and a sunny
place. They are very easy to grow.</p>

<p><b><a name="carnations" id="carnations"></a>Carnations</b> are of two types, the outdoor or
garden varieties, and the indoor or forcing kinds. Normally,
the Carnation is a hardy perennial, but the garden
kinds, or Marguerites, are usually treated as annuals. The
forcing kinds are flowered but once, new plants being grown
each year from cuttings.</p>

<p>Marguerite Carnations bloom the year the seed is sown,
and with a slight protection will bloom freely the second
year. They make attractive house plants if potted
in the fall. The seeds of these Carnations should be sown
in boxes in March and the young plants set out as early as
possible, pinching out the center of the plant to make them
branch freely. Give the same space as for garden pinks.</p>

</div>

<p>The winter-flowering Carnations have become prime
favorites with all flower lovers, and a collection of winter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
house plants seems incomplete without them. Carnations
grow readily from cuttings made of the suckers that form
around the base of the stem, the side shoots of the flowering
stem, or the main shoots before they show flower buds. The
cuttings from the base make the best plants in
most cases. These cuttings may be taken from
a plant at any time through the fall or winter,
rooted in sand and potted up, to be held
in pots until the planting out time in the
spring, usually in April, or any time when the
ground is ready to handle. Care should be
taken to pinch out the tops of young plants
while growing in the pot, and later while in
the ground, causing them to grow stocky and
send out new growths along the stem. The
young plants should be grown cool, a temperature
of 45° suiting them well. Attention
should be given to spraying the cuttings each day while in
the house to keep down the red spider, which is very partial
to the Carnation. In the summer, the plants are
grown in the field, and not in pots. The soil in
which they are to be planted should be moderately
rich and loose. Clean cultivation should be given
throughout the summer. Frequently pinch out the
tops. The plants are taken up in September and
potted firmly, and well watered; then set in a
cool, partially shaded situation until root growth
has started, spraying the foliage often, and watering
the plant only as it shows need of water.</p>

<p>The usual living-room conditions as to moisture
and heat are not such as the Carnation demands, and care
must be taken to overcome the dryness by spraying the foliage
and setting the plant in a position not exposed to the
direct heat of a stove or the sun. In commercial houses, it
is not often necessary to spray established plants. Pick off
most or all of the side buds, in order to add to the size of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the leading flowers. After all is said, it is probably advisable
in most cases to purchase the plants when in bloom
from a florist, and after blooming either throw them away
or store them for planting in the spring, when they will
bloom throughout the summer.</p>

<p class="caption">Cauliflower</p>
</div>

<p><b>Cauliflower.</b> The general culture of Cauliflower
is much like that of cabbage, except that the Cauliflower,
being more tender, should be more thoroughly hardened
off before setting out. Still, it is essential that the plants
be set out as early as possible, as the warm weather of
June causes them to make imperfect heads unless the soil
is filled with moisture. No garden crop will as well repay
the cost and time of thorough irrigation, either by running
the water between the rows or applying it directly to the
plants. When it is impossible to furnish water, it would
be a good plan to mulch heavily with straw or some other
substance. This mulch, if put on just after a heavy
rain, will hold the moisture for a long time. When the
heads begin to form the outside leaves may be brought together
and tied above the head, excluding the direct sunshine
and keeping the head white and
tender. No vegetable will respond
more quickly to good culture and
well manured soil than the Cauliflower,
and none will prove such an
utter failure when neglected. It is
imperative that care be taken to destroy
all the cabbage worms before
the leaves are tied in, as after that
it will be impossible to see or reach them. Cauliflower
prospers best in moist soil and a cool climate. From 1,000
to 1,500 plants may be grown from 1 ounce of seed. Good
Cauliflower seed is very expensive.</p>

<p>For winter crop, seeds may be started in June or July,
as for late cabbage.</p>

<p>Erfurt, Snowball and Paris are popular early varieties.
Nonpareil and Algiers are good late kinds.</p>

<p><b>Celeriac</b>, or <span class="smcap">Turnip-rooted Celery</span>. This
tuber has the celery flavor in a pronounced degree, and is
used for flavoring soups and for celery salad. It may be
served raw, sliced in vinegar and oil, or boiled. The culture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is the same as given for celery, except that no earthing or
blanching is required. About an equal number of plants are
obtained from the same weight of seed as from celery seed.
Celeriac is extensively used abroad, but, unfortunately, is
little grown in America.</p>

<p><b>Celery</b> has become one of the favorite relish
and salad vegetables, and is now very generally grown. The
self-blanching varieties have simplified the culture so that
the amateur, as well as the expert, may have a supply
through at least six months of the year. The so-called new
culture, which consists of setting the plants close together
and causing them to shade each other, can be recommended
for the garden when a supply of well rotted manure is to be
had, and when any amount of water is available. This
method is as follows: Fork or spade
into the soil a large quantity of manure
to the depth of 10-12 in., pulverize the
soil until the ground for the depth of 4-6
in. is in very fine condition. Then set
the plants in rows 10 in. apart and the
plants but 5 or 6 in. apart in the rows.
It will be seen that plants set as close
as this will soon fill the soil with a mass
of roots and must have large amounts
of plant-food, as well as a large quantity
of water; and the making of such
a bed can be recommended only to
those who can supply these needs.</p>

<p class="caption">Celery</p>
</div>

<p>The common practice in home gardens is to plow or dig a
shallow trench, setting the plants in the bottom and hoeing
in the soil as the plants grow. The distance apart of the
rows and plants will depend on the varieties. For the dwarf
varieties, such as White Plume, Golden Self-blanching and
others of that type, the rows may be as close as 3 ft. and the
plants 6 in. in the rows. For the large-growing varieties, as
Kalamazoo, Giant Pascal and, in fact, most of the late varieties,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the rows may be from 4½ to 5 ft. apart and the plants
7 or 8 in. in the row.</p>

<p>The seed for an early crop should be sown in February or
early in March in shallow boxes, which may be placed in a
hotbed or sunny window, or sown directly in the soil of a
hotbed. Cover the seeds thinly and press the soil firmly
over them. When the seedling plants are about one inch
high they should be transplanted to other boxes or hotbeds,
setting the plants 1 in. apart in rows 3 in. apart. At
this transplanting, as with the following ones, the tall leaves
should be cut or pinched off, leaving only the upright growth,
as with the utmost care it is almost impossible to prevent
the outside leafstalks from wilting down and dying. The
roots of the plants should also be trimmed back at each transplanting
in order to increase the feeding roots. The plants
should be set as deep as possible, care being taken, however,
not to allow the heart of the plant to be covered up. The
varieties usually grown for an early crop are the so-called
self-blanching varieties. They may be made fit for the table
with much less labor than the late crop, the shade required
to blanch the stalks being much less. When only a few short
rows are grown in a private garden, screens of lath may be
made by driving stakes on each side of the row and tacking
lath on, leaving spaces of an inch or more for the light to
enter; or each head may be wrapped in paper, or a tile drain
pipe may be set over the plant. In fact, any material that
will exclude the light will render the stalks white and
brittle.</p>

<p>The seed for the main or fall crop should be sown in April
or early May in a seed bed prepared by forking fine, well
rotted manure into a fine soil, sowing the seed thinly in
rows 8 or 10 in. apart, covering the seed lightly and firming
over the seed with the feet, hoe or back of a spade.
This seed bed should be kept moist at all times until the
seed germinates, either by close attention to watering or by
a lath screen. The use of a piece of cloth laid directly on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the soil, and the bed wet through the cloth, is often recommended,
and if the cloth is always wet and taken off the
bed as soon as the seed sprouts it can be used. After the
young plants have grown to the height of 1 or 2 in. they
must be thinned out, leaving the plants so that they do not
touch each other, and transplanting those thinned&mdash;if wanted&mdash;to
other ground prepared in the same manner as the seed
bed. All these plants may be sheared or cut back to induce
stockiness.</p>

<p>If in a private garden, the ground on which the fall
crop is usually set will likely be land from which a crop of
some early vegetable has been taken. This land should be
again well enriched with fine, well rotted manure, to which
may be added a liberal amount of wood ashes. If the manure
or ashes are not easily obtained, a small amount may
be used by plowing or digging out a furrow 8 or 12 in. deep,
scattering the manure and ashes in the bottom of the trench
and filling it up almost level with the surface. The plants
should be set about the middle of July, preferably just before
a rain. The plant bed should have a thorough soaking
shortly before the plants are lifted, and each plant be trimmed,
both top and root, before setting. The plants should
be set from 5 to 6 in. apart in the rows and the earth well
firmed around each one.</p>

<p>The after-cultivation consists in thorough tillage
until the time of “handling” or earthing up the
plants. This process of handling is accomplished by
drawing up the earth with one hand while holding the
plant with the other, packing the soil well around the stalks.
This process may be continued until only the leaves are to
be seen. For the private grower, it is much easier to blanch
the Celery with boards or paper, or if the Celery is not
wanted until winter, the plants may be dug up, packed
closely in boxes, covering the roots with soil, and placed in
a dark, cool cellar, where the stalks will blanch themselves.
In this manner Celery may be stored in boxes in the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
cellar. Put earth in the bottom of a deep box, and plant
the Celery in it. An ounce of seed will furnish about three
thousand plants.</p>

<p><b><a name="centaurea" id="centaurea"></a>Centaurea.</b> Showy annuals and perennials.
<i>C. Cyanus</i> is the <span class="smcap">Corn Flower</span> or <span class="smcap">Bachelor Button</span>,
familiar to every flower lover, and always seen in old-fashioned
gardens. This is a fine plant for borders or
mixed beds, and also gives good flowers for bouquets. A
bunch of the Corn Flower, with a sprinkling of yellow
marigolds or California poppy, makes a rich effect.
These Centaureas are easy of culture, seeding themselves
after once being planted, and coming up year after year in
great profusion. There are blue, white and rose varieties.
Annuals. 2-3 ft. Hardy.</p>

<p>The silver-leaved Centaureas are used only for foliage
effects. They are excellent for ribbon beds or border lines.
The seed of these should be started in a hotbed or box in
March, the young plants being set out where wanted when
the ground becomes warm. These species are perennials,
and are sometimes grown from cuttings. <i>C. candidissima</i>
and <i>C. gymnocarpa</i> are among the best white-leaved bedders.</p>

<p><b>Centranthus.</b> Low-growing hardy annuals in
two colors, red and white. They make very effective
covering for low rockwork, and are also suitable for vases
or lawn baskets. Sow where the plants are to stand, or
start indoors if early bloom is wanted. 1 ft. Thin to 10-12
in. apart.</p>

<p><b>Century Plant</b>, or <span class="smcap">Agave</span>. These are fine ornamental
plants for the window-garden or conservatory, requiring
but little care and growing slowly, thus needing
repotting only at long intervals. When the plants have
outgrown their usefulness as house plants, they are still
valuable as porch decorations, for plunging in rockwork or
about rustic nooks. The striped-leaved variety is the most
desirable, but the common type, with its blue-gray leaves,
is highly ornamental.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
There are a number of dwarf-growing species of Agave
that are not so common, although they may be grown with
ease. Such plants add novelty to a collection, and may be
used through the summer as noted above or plunged with
cactus in a bed of tropical plants. All succeed well in
loam and sand in equal parts, adding a little leaf-mold in
the case of the small varieties. The more common species
are propagated by suckers from around the base of the
established plants. A few kinds having no suckers must
be grown from seed. As to watering, they demand no
special care. Agaves will not stand frost.</p>

<p><b><a name="cereus" id="cereus"></a>Cereus.</b> Under the name of <span class="smcap">Night-blooming
Cereuses</span>, several species of Cacti are cultivated. The name
is sometimes applied to species of Phyllocactus, the flowers
of which, in white and shades of red, sometimes open at
nightfall. Phyllocactuses are easy to grow. <a href="#cactus">See <i>Cactus</i>.</a>
The true Night-blooming Cereuses, however, are species of
the genus Cereus. The commonest one is <i>C. nycticalus</i>, but
<i>C. grandiflorus</i>, <i>C. triangularis</i> and others are occasionally
seen. These true Night-blooming Cereuses all have long rod-like
stems, which are cylindrical or angular. These stems
often reach a height of 10 to 30 ft., and they need support.
They should be trained along a pillar or tied to a stake.
They are uninteresting leafless things during a large part
of the year; but in midsummer, after they are three or
more years old, they throw out their great tubular flowers,
which open at nightfall and wither and die when the light
strikes them next morning. They are very easily grown,
either in pots or planted in the natural soil in the conservatory.
The only special care they need is good drainage at
the roots, so that the soil will not become soggy.</p>

<p class="caption">Sweet Cherry</p>
</div>

<p><b>Cherry.</b> Of Cherries there are two common
types, the sweet Cherries and the sour Cherries. The sweet
Cherries are larger and taller-growing trees. They comprise
the varieties known as the Hearts, Bigarreaus and
Dukes. The sour Cherries include the various kinds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Morellos and pie Cherries, and these usually ripen after the
sweet Cherries. The sour Cherries make low, round-headed
trees. The fruits are extensively used for
canning. Cherry trees should be planted
when 2 and 3 years old. Too rich soil tends
to make growth at the expense of fruit, particularly
in the sweet Cherries. For the
sweet types, a strong, gravelly loam is best.
Sour Cherries thrive well on clay loams.</p>

<p>Trees of the sour Cherry should be
planted 18 by 18 ft. apart, in well prepared
under-drained soil. The trees may be
slightly trimmed back each year, keeping
the head low and bushy.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 167px;">
<img src="images/067-cherry2.jpg" width="167" height="164" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Black Tartarian Cherry</p>
</div>

<p>The sweet Cherries have proved disappointing in many
instances from the rotting of the fruit. This may never be
entirely avoided, but good cultivation, soil not too rich in
nitrogen, attention to spraying, and picking the fruit when
dry, will lessen the loss very much. In years
of severe rotting, the fruit should be picked
before it becomes fully ripe, placed in a cool,
airy room and allowed to color. It will be
nearly as well flavored as if left on the tree;
and, as the fungus usually attacks only the
ripe fruit, a considerable part of the crop may
be saved. Set the trees 25 or 30 ft. apart.</p>

<p>Leaf-blight is readily controlled by timely
spraying with Bordeaux mixture. The curculio or fruit worm
is best controlled by jarring, as for plums (<a href="#plum">which see</a>).</p>

<p>Of sweet Cherries, Windsor is the most popular variety.
Other good kinds are Napoleon, Governor Wood, Dikeman,
Black Tartarian. Of sour Cherries, Ostheim and Early
Richmond are very early and productive, but better kinds
are Montmorency and English Morello.</p>

<p><b>Chervil.</b> The curled Chervil is a good addition
to the list of garnishing vegetables, and adds flavor to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
dishes when it is used to season. Sow seeds and cultivate
the same as parsley.</p>

<p>The tuberous Chervil resembles a short carrot or
parsnip. It is much esteemed in France and Germany.
The tubers have somewhat the flavor of a sweet potato, perhaps
a little sweeter. They are perfectly hardy, and, like
the parsnip, the better for frosts. The seed may be
sown in September or October, as it does not keep well; or
as soon as the ground is fit to work in the spring, it being
slow to germinate after the weather becomes hot and dry.
One packet of seed will give all the plants necessary.</p>

<p><b>Chestnuts.</b> Of Chestnuts there are three types
in cultivation: the European, the Japanese, and the American.
The American, or native Chestnuts, of which there
are several improved varieties, are the hardiest and most
reliable, and the nuts are the sweetest, but they are also the
smallest. The Japanese varieties are usually injured by the
winter in central New York. The European varieties are
somewhat hardier, and some of the varieties will thrive in
the northern states. Chestnuts are very easily grown.
They usually bear better when two or more trees are
planted near each other. There are few really good Chestnut
orchards in North America, but Chestnut planting is now
considerably agitated. Sprouts in old Chestnut clearings
are often allowed to remain, and sometimes they are
grafted to the improved varieties. The young trees may be
grafted in the spring by the whip-graft or cleft-graft
method; but the cions should be perfectly dormant, and
the operation should be very carefully done. Even with
the best workmanship, a considerable percentage of the
grafts are likely to fail or to break off after two or three
years. The most popular single variety of Chestnut is the
Paragon, which bears large and excellent nuts when the
tree is very young. When the home ground is large
enough, two or three of these trees should be planted near
the borders.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<b>Chicory.</b> The Magdeburg Chicory is the variety
usually spoken of, it being the one most extensively
grown. The roots of this, after being ground and
roasted, are used either as a substitute or an adulterant of
coffee.</p>

<p>The Witloof, a form of Chicory, is used as a salad,
or boiled and served in the same manner as Cauliflower.
The plants should be thinned to 6 in. In the latter part of
summer they should be banked up like celery, and the leaves
used after becoming white and tender. This and the common
wild Chicory are often dug in the fall, the leaves cut
off, the roots packed in sand in a cellar and watered until a
new growth of leaves starts. These leaves grow rapidly and
are very tender, making a fine salad vegetable. One
packet of seed of the Witloof will furnish plants enough for
a large family.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/069-chrysanth.jpg" width="90" height="157" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Chrysanthemum</p>
</div>

<p><b>Chrysanthemums</b> are both annual and perennial.
The annual Chrysanthemums must not be confounded
with the well known fall-flowering kinds, as they
will prove a disappointment if one expects large flowers of
all colors and shapes. The annuals are mostly coarse-growing
plants, with an abundance of bloom and a
rank smell. The flowers are single in most cases, and
not very lasting. They are useful for massing and
also for cut-flowers. They are among the easiest of
hardy annuals to grow. The stoniest part of the
garden will usually suit them. 1-2 ft. Colors white
and shades of yellow, the flowers daisy-like.</p>

<p>Amongst perennial kinds, <i>Chrysanthemum frutescens</i>
is the well known Paris Daisy or Marguerite, one of
the most popular of the genus. This makes a very fine pot-plant
for the window-garden, blooming throughout the winter
and spring months. It is usually propagated by cuttings,
which, if taken in spring, will give large blooming
plants for the next winter. Gradually transfer to larger
pots or boxes, until the plants finally stand in 6-inch or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
8-inch pots or in small soap boxes. There is a fine yellow-flowered
variety.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/070-chrysbox.jpg" width="180" height="194" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Chrysanthemums in a box</p>
</div>

<p>In variety of form and color, and in size of bloom, the
florists’ Chrysanthemum is one of the most
wonderful of plants. It is a late autumn
flower, and it needs little artificial heat to
bring it to perfection. The great blooms of
the exhibitions are produced by growing
only one flower to a plant and by feeding
the plant heavily. It is hardly possible for
the amateur to grow such specimen flowers
as the professional florist or gardener does;
neither is it necessary. A well-grown plant
with fourteen to twenty flowers is far more satisfactory as
a window plant than a long, stiff stem with only one immense
flower at the apex. Their culture is simple, much
more so than that of many of the plants commonly grown
for house decoration. Although their season of bloom is
short, the satisfaction of having a fall display of flowers
before the geraniums, begonias and other house
plants have recovered from their removal from out
of doors, repays all efforts.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/070-chryscut.jpg" width="105" height="249" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Cutting of
Chrysanthemum</p>
</div>

<p>Cuttings taken in March or April, planted out in
the border in May, well tended through the summer
and lifted before frost in September, will bloom in
October or November. The ground in which they
are planted should be moderately rich and moist.
The plants may be tied to stakes. When the buds
show, all but the center one of each cluster on the
leading shoots should be picked off, as also the small
lateral branches. A thrifty bushy plant thus treated
will usually have flowers large enough to show the
character of the variety, also enough flowers to make
a fine display. As to the receptacle into which to put
them when lifted from the border, it need not be a
flower pot. A pail or soap box, with holes bored for drainage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
will suit the plant just as well, and by covering the
box with cloth or paper the difference will not be noticed.
If cuttings are not to be had, young plants may be bought
of the florists and treated in the manner described.
Buy them in midsummer or earlier.</p>

<p class="caption">Hardy
Chrysanthemum</p>
</div>

<p>It is best not to attempt to flower the same plant
two seasons. After the plant has bloomed, the top
may be cut down, and the box set in a cellar and
kept moderately dry. In February or March,
bring the plant to the sitting-room window
and let the shoots start from the root. These
shoots are taken for cuttings to grow plants
for the fall bloom.</p>

<p>There is a hardy race of Chrysanthemums, very
excellent for the border. Mulch in winter. The best
bloom is usually given the first and second years.</p>

<p><b>Cineraria.</b> A tender greenhouse plant. It may
be grown as a house plant, although the conditions necessary
to the best results are hard to obtain outside of a
greenhouse. The conditions for their growing are a cool
temperature, frequent repotting and guarding against the
attacks of the greenfly. Perhaps the last is the most difficult,
and with one having no facilities for fumigating, it
will be almost impossible to prevent the difficulty. A
living room usually has too dry air for Cinerarias. The
seed, which is very minute, should be sown in August or
September to have plants in bloom in January or February.
Sow the seed on the surface of fine soil and water
very lightly to settle the seeds into the soil. A piece of
glass or a damp cloth may be spread over the pot or box
in which the seeds are sown, to remain until the seeds are
up. Always keep the soil damp, but not wet. When the
seedlings are large enough to repot, they should be potted
singly in 2- or 3-inch pots. Before the plants have become
pot-bound, they should again be repotted into larger
pots, until they are in at least a 6-inch pot in which to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
bloom. In all this time, they should be grown cool and,
if not possible to fumigate them with tobacco smoke, the
pots should stand on tobacco stems, which should be moist
at all times. The general practice, in order to have bushy
plants, is to pinch out the center when the flower buds
show, causing the lateral branches to start, which they are
slow to do if the central stem is allowed to grow. Plants
bloom but once.</p>

<p><b>Cives.</b> These belong to the onion family, and
are propagated by division of the root. They may be planted
in a permanent place in the border, and, being hardy, will
remain for years. The leaves are the parts used, as the
roots are very rank in flavor. The leaves may be cut frequently,
as they readily grow again.</p>

<p><b>Clarkia.</b> The Clarkias are among the popular
hardy edging and vase annuals, bearing rose, white or
bordered flowers in great profusion. The double-flowering
varieties are the most showy, but the single ones
will prove very satisfactory. The seeds may be sown where
the plants are wanted, or started in frames for earlier
flowers. 6-18 in. high. Thin to 6-12 in. apart. Plant
in a warm soil and sunny place.</p>

<p><b>Clematis.</b> One of the best of woody climbing
vines. The common <i>C. Flammula</i>, <i>Virginiana</i>, <i>paniculata</i>
and others are used frequently to cover division walls or
fences, growing year after year without any care and producing
quantities of flowers. <i>C. paniculata</i> is now planted
very extensively. The panicles of star-shaped flowers entirely
cover the vine and have a pleasant fragrance. One
of the best of all fall-flowering vines, and hardy North.
Clings well to a chicken-wire trellis.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 170px;">
<img src="images/073-clematis.jpg" width="170" height="71" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Clematis paniculata</p>
</div>

<p>The large-flowered section, of which Jackmani is perhaps
the best known, is very popular for pillar or porch
climbers. The flowers of this section are large and showy,
running from pure white, through blue, to scarlet. Of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
class, the most serviceable purple is Jackmani; white,
Henryi; blue, Ramona; crimson, Madame E. André.</p>

<p>The Flammula class may be propagated by division of
the roots. The large-flowered kinds are propagated by
layers or root-grafting on <i>C. Flammula</i> and others.</p>

<p>A deep, mellow, rich soil, naturally moist, will suit the
requirements of Clematis. In dry times apply water freely,
particularly for the large-flowered kinds. Also
provide trellis or other support as soon as they
begin to run. Clematis usually blooms on the
wood of the season: therefore prune in winter
or early spring, in order to secure strong new
flowering shoots. The large-flowered kinds should be cut
back to the ground each year; and other kinds may be similarly
treated unless they are wanted for permanent bowers.</p>

<p>The Clematis root disease is the depredation of a nematode
or eel-worm. It is seldom troublesome in ground
which thoroughly freezes.</p>

<p><b>Climbers.</b> <a href="#vines">Treated under <i>Vines</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Cobæa.</b> This is most commonly seen in the
greenhouse, although it is one of the best of tender
climbers for porches. Seed sown in February or March,
and grown in gentle heat, will make suitable plants for setting
out by June. It may also be grown from cuttings of
the young wood, taken in February and rooted in brisk
heat. The flowers of <i>C. scandens</i> are shaped very much
like those of the Campanulas, but are larger. They open a
greenish white and deepen to a dark purple in the course of
a few days. The vines in full bloom have a gradation of
colors as the flowers are in different stages of development.
The variegated form of <i>C. scandens</i> should be propagated
by cuttings to hold the variegation. Grows 10-15 ft.
Tender. Climbs by means of tendrils.</p>

<p><b>Cockscomb.</b> <i>Celosia cristata</i> is the well known
Cockscomb, having combs or heads of scarlet, crimson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
rose and yellow. The combs are often saved for winter
bouquets by cutting them off before thoroughly ripe and
drying them. The feathered section comprises tall-growing
plants with plumes of various colors which, with the colored
leaves of some varieties, make a striking feature in a
border. The Celosias, being tender, should be started in a
hotbed or frame, potted off when out of the seed-leaf, and
planted out in well enriched soil after danger of frost is
past, 1½-2½ ft. high.</p>

<p><b><a name="coldframe" id="coldframe"></a>Coldframe.</b> A Coldframe is a simple, low
structure, covered with glass or oiled paper or cloth, in
which plants are grown without artificial heat. It differs
from the hotbed in the fact that it has no bottom heat. The
atmosphere in the Coldframe is warmer than that outside,
because it is protected from the winds and because there
is more or less of the sun’s heat stored up in the earth.
For the details of construction of the Coldframe, <a href="#hotbed">see
<i>Hotbed</i></a>.</p>

<p>A Coldframe is ordinarily used for later work than the hotbed:
that is, seeds may be sown in a Coldframe from two to
three and sometimes four weeks in advance of their sowing
in the open; whereas in a hotbed the seeds may be started
from one to three months earlier than they may be out of
doors. Coldframes are sometimes used for the wintering
over of hardy plants which are started in the fall. For
example, cabbage seed may be sown in September in a
Coldframe and the young plants may be protected therein
during the winter. If they are properly grown and hardened
off, they will not be injured by the winter, even
though they freeze. Lettuce and sometimes cauliflowers are
carried over in the same way. Coldframes are also used to
receive plants which have outgrown the hotbed and must be
transplanted. Plants which need hardening off may also be
transplanted from the hotbed into the Coldframe. The
Coldframe in these cases is an intermediate stage between
the hotbed and the open field.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
<b>Coleus.</b> A well known foliage plant for pot
culture or bedding. It was used very extensively at one
time in ornamental bedding and ribbon borders, but owing
to its being tender has lost in favor, and its place is
largely taken by other plants. Cuttings root very readily.
It may also be grown from seed, although the types have
not become fixed, and a large number of differently marked
plants may be had from the same packet. This would not
be a drawback in the window-garden, unless a uniform
effect is wished. Sow the seed in gentle heat in March.
Make new plants from cuttings each year, and throw the
old ones away.</p>

<p><b><a name="collards" id="collards"></a>Collards.</b> This is a name given to a kind of
kale, used when young as greens; also to young cabbages
used in the same way. The seed of any early cabbage
may be sown thickly in rows 18 inches apart, from early
spring to late fall. The plants are cut off when 6 or 8
inches high and boiled as are other greens. The kale
Collards is grown in the South, where cabbages fail to
head. It grows to the height of 2 to 6 feet, furnishing a
large quantity of leaves.</p>

<p><b>Collinsia.</b> A hardy annual that should be
sown in the fall, where wanted, if early flowers are desired.
The flowers of all the varieties are showy, either in masses
or planted in a border. Give them a position near the front,
as the plants rarely exceed 18 inches in height.</p>

<p><b>Columbine.</b> <a href="#aquilegia">See <i>Aquilegia</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Compost.</b> <a href="#manure">See <i>Manure</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Convolvulus.</b> <a href="#morning-glory">See <i>Morning-Glory</i>.</a></p>

<p><b><a name="coreopsis" id="coreopsis"></a>Coreopsis</b>, or <span class="smcap">Calliopsis</span>. Very showy hardy
annuals, growing from 1 to 3 feet high, and covered throughout
the season with a profusion of bloom. The colors range
from lemon-yellow to dark velvety brown. Excellent for
cutting, and very effective in mixed borders. They thrive in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
any garden soil if they have full sunlight. Sow where
they are to grow, letting the plants stand 6-12 in. apart for
mass effects.</p>

<p><b>Corn Salad.</b> This is one of the earliest spring
salad vegetables, coming into condition to use with spinach,
and needing the same culture. Sown in the fall, and covered
with straw or hay when cold weather sets in, it will
start into rapid growth when the covering is removed in
March or April. Or the seed may be sown in early spring,
and plants will be fit to use in six or eight weeks. One
packet of seed will suffice for a small family.</p>

<p><b><a name="corn" id="corn"></a>Corn, Sweet</b>, is not so generally used as it
should be. Usually when planted at all, only one planting
of one kind is made. The ears come to edible maturity
almost simultaneously, and a short season of Sweet Corn is
the result. The first planting should be made from May 1
to 10, planting early, intermediate and late varieties at the
same time, then at intervals of two weeks until the middle
of July, when the late varieties should be planted, thus
having a succession from the first crop until October.
The soil for Corn should be rich in plant-food, and the
coarser manure left from the preparation of the ground for
small crops may be used to good advantage. Corn for the
garden is better planted in drills, the drills 3 feet apart,
dropping the seed from 10 to 12 inches apart in the drills.
One quart of seed will plant 200 hills.</p>

<p>For extra early, Marblehead, Adams, Vermont, Minnesota
and Early Cory are favorites. For later crop, Crosby,
Hickox, Shoe Peg and Stowell Evergreen are now popular.</p>

<p><b>Cosmos.</b> The Cosmos grown in a locality free
from early fall frosts is certainly a beautiful thing, but
there are probably few flowers that have caused so much disappointment
to the flower lover in the North. The seed
germinates very freely. The plants grow with great vigor,
and if the season permits, an abundance of bloom may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
had in September. An early-flowering strain of dwarf Cosmos
has been offered by the trade for several years; and
each year there seems to be an improvement in the size and
colors, so the time may shortly come when this will equal
the late-flowering varieties, making the culture of Cosmos
more satisfactory. Cosmos flowers are borne on long
stems, and the colors are in white and fine shades of red.
The foliage is also fine. Seed should be sown in gentle
heat, in the greenhouse, hotbed or window in early April,
and the young plants transplanted when 2 inches high,
setting the plants well down in the soil and giving at least
3 inches between the plants, as they are very likely to spindle
up, with weak stems, if crowded. When danger of frost
is over, set them out in a warm, well sheltered position,
3 feet apart. After the plants start into growth, pinch
out the top to induce a bushy growth. If situated where
the wind can whip them, they should have a stake driven
close to the stem, and be tied to it for support. Flowers
of Cosmos are on the order of single Dahlias.</p>

<p><b>Cranberry.</b> The growing of Cranberries in artificial
bogs is an American industry. The common large
Cranberry of markets is also a peculiarly American fruit,
since it is unknown in other countries except as the fruit is
shipped there. Cranberries are grown in bogs, which may
be flooded. The whole area is kept under water during the
winter time, largely to prevent the plants from winter injury
by the heaving and freezing and thawing of the bogs.
Flooding is also employed at intervals for the purpose of
drowning out insects, mitigating drought, and protecting
against frost and fires. Every good Cranberry bog should
have facilities for flooding. The ordinary practice is to choose
a bog which has a creek running through it, or through
which some creek or ditch may be diverted. At the lower
side of the bog flood gates are provided, so that when the
gates are shut the water backs up and floods the area. It
is best that the bog be comparatively flat, so that the water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
will be of approximately equal depth over the whole area.
At the shallowest places the water should stand about a foot
above the plants. The water is usually let on the bog early
in December and kept on until April or early May. No flooding
is done during the rest of the year unless there is some
particular occasion therefor.</p>

<p>All the wild and turfy growth should be taken off the
bog before the vines are set. This is done either by digging
it off and removing it bodily, or by drowning it out by
means of a year’s flooding. The former method is generally
considered to be the better. After the turfy growth
is removed, the bog is smoothed and covered 2 or 3 in.
deep with clean sand. The vines are now set, the lower
ends of them being shoved through the sand into the richer
earth. In order to prevent a too rapid and tangled growth
of vine, it is customary to resand the bog every three or
four years to a depth of one-fourth or one-half inch.
When sanding is not practicable, the vines may be mown
off when they become too luxuriant.</p>

<p>The plants for setting are merely cuttings or branches of
the vines. These cuttings may be from 5 to 10 in. long.
They are inserted into the ground in a hole made by a
crowbar or stick. They are usually planted at distances of
12 to 18 in. each way, and the vines are allowed to cover
the entire ground as with a mat. In three years a good
crop should be secured, if the weeds and wild growth are
kept down. A crop ranges between 50 to 100 barrels per
acre.</p>

<p><b>Cress.</b> The Upland Cress, or the true <span class="smcap">Pepper
Grass</span>, may be grown on any garden soil. Sow early in the
spring. It makes a rapid growth and can be cut from
four to five weeks. Succession of sowings must be made,
as it runs quickly to seed. The curled variety is the one
usually grown, as the leaves may be used for garnishing as
well as for salads. One packet of seed will be sufficient for
each sowing. Any good soil will do. Sow thickly in drills<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
12-18 in. apart. In summer it runs to seed quickly, so that
it is usually grown in spring and fall.</p>

<p>The Water Cress is more exacting in its culture, and can
only be successfully grown in moist places, such as edges of
shallow, slow-running creeks, open drains, or beds excavated
near such streams. A few plants for private use may be
grown in a frame, provided a retentive soil is used and attention
given to watering the bed often. Water Cress may
be propagated from pieces of the stem, used as cuttings. If
one is fond of Water Cress, it is well to colonize it in some
clean creek or pool. It will take care of itself year by year.
Seeds may also be used for propagating it.</p>

<p><b><a name="crocus" id="crocus"></a>Crocus.</b> A hardy bulb, easily grown and giving
good satisfaction either in the border or scattered
through the lawn. They are also forced for winter (<a href="#bulbs">see
<i>Bulbs</i></a>). They are so cheap and lasting that they may be
used in quantity. A border of them along the edges of
walks, little clumps of them in the lawn, or masses in a
bed, give the first touch of color as the spring opens. They
may be forced with ease planted in pots or shallow boxes,
put away in a cool place and brought into the house at any
time through the winter. A low temperature will bring
them into bloom in perfection in about four weeks from the
time they are brought in. They can be had in the window-garden
in this way.</p>

<p>A sandy soil suits the Crocus admirably. Plant in the
fall, in the open, setting them 3 to 4 inches deep. When they
show signs of failing, take up the bulbs and reset them.
They tend to rise out of the ground, because the new bulb or
corm forms on the top of the old one. If best results are
desired, it is well to renew the bed occasionally by buying
new bulbs. Crocus beds may be filled later in the season
with quick-growing annuals.</p>

<p><b>Croton.</b> Under this name many varieties and
so-called species of Codiæum are grown for conservatory
decoration, and latterly for foliage bedding in the open.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
The colors and shapes of the leaves are very various and attractive.
The Crotons make good window-garden subjects,
although they are very liable to the attack of the mealy bug.
They are propagated readily by cuttings of half-ripened
wood any time during winter or spring. The plants should
be given an abundance of light in order to bring out their
fine colors; but it is usually advisable to screen them from
the direct rays of the sun when they are grown under glass.
If the red spider or the mealy bug attack them, they may
be syringed with tobacco water. Plants which are propagated
indoors during the winter may be massed in beds
out of doors during the summer, where they make very
striking effects. Give them rich, deep soil, and be sure
that they are syringed frequently enough on the under
side of the leaves to keep down the red spider. If the
plants have been gradually subjected to strong light before
they are taken out of doors, they will stand the full sunlight
and will develop their rich colors to perfection. In the
fall they may be taken up, cut back and used for window-garden
or conservatory subjects. Crotons are shrubs or
small trees, and they may be transferred into large pots or
tubs and grown on into large tree-like specimens.</p>

<p><b><a name="cucumber" id="cucumber"></a>Cucumber.</b> For early use, the Cucumber is
usually started in a hotbed or coldframe by sowing the seed
on pieces of sod 4 to 6 inches square, turned grass side
down. Three or four seeds are placed on or pushed into
each piece of sod and covered with 1 to 2 inches of fine soil.
The soil should be well watered and the glass or cloth placed
over the frame. The roots will run through the sod. When
the plants are large enough to set out, a flat trowel or a
shingle may be slipped under the sod and the plants moved
to the hill without check. In place of sod, old quart
berry boxes are good; after setting in the hill the roots
may force their way through the cracks in the baskets. The
baskets also decay rapidly. Flower pots may be used.
These plants from the frames may be set out when danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of frost is over, usually by the 10th of May, and should make
a very rapid growth, yielding good-sized fruits in two
months. The hills should be made rich by forking in a
quantity of well rotted manure, and given a slight elevation
above the garden&mdash;not high enough to allow
the wind to dry the soil, but slightly raised
so that water will not stand around the roots.
One ounce of seed will plant fifty hills. The
hills may be 4-5 ft. apart each way.</p>

<p class="caption">Cucumbers</p>
</div>

<p>The White Spine is the leading general-purpose variety.
For very early or pickling sorts, the Chicago, Russian, and
other picklings are good.</p>

<p>The striped beetle is an inveterate pest on Cucumbers
and squashes. Following is the latest advice (Hall and
Sirrine, New York State Experiment Station): “Poisons can
be used with success against these beetles for only a short
time in the spring, when they begin to feed; and again, in
the fall, against beetles of the new brood. This fall poisoning
will succeed only where there is not an abundance
of wild fall flowers; for the beetles will desert any poisoned
crop for the unpoisoned flowers and will feed upon the
flowers to a considerable extent, anyhow, if they are to be
found. Green arsenite, dry, gave best results. It was
found a waste of the poisons to apply them in Bordeaux
mixture, as the mixture so repelled the insects that they
would not eat the sprayed vines to secure the poison.
These poisons, applied in water, are liable to burn or stunt
the plants. It is necessary, then, if we wish to poison the
beetles, to use a trap crop to attract the insects and to apply
the poison to this crop instead of to the plants we design to
protect. On small areas it may be advisable to shut in the
small plants of the growing crop by the well known cloth-topped
boxes; by the tent-like cloth covers spread over arched
hoops or wires; by boxes made from a rectangular piece of
cloth and two short 6-inch boards with cleats attached to
insert in the soil and hold the boards upright; or even 6-inch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
wire plate-covers. Covers, however, are too expensive
on large areas, and they have the disadvantage of frequently
making the plants weak, so that winds will snap
them off or twist and ruin them when the covers have to be
removed. If covers are used alone, their removal leaves
the unprotected vines not only for feeding places but for
breeding places for the beetles.</p>

<p>“Bordeaux mixture, if thoroughly and frequently applied,
makes as efficient a protection as the covers, is much
cheaper, and at the same time protects the plants from diseases.
This mixture (1-to-11 formula) should be sprayed
upon the Cucumbers when they are just well up, again when
they show the third leaf, and the third time just before the
plants commence to form runners. The early application
can probably best be made with a knapsack sprayer, and
later ones by any good pump sprayer. The three applications
should not cost over $2 per acre. The Bordeaux mixture
is a much better repellant, according to station tests,
than kerosene, turpentine, tobacco dust, cow manure, burdock
infusion, slug shot, bug death, or any other known
compound. Indeed, all materials of this class, supposed to
drive away the beetles by their distasteful odor, proved failures
when used alone. Air-slaked lime, dusted over the
vines, will make them unpalatable to the beetles, but the
lime is liable to stunt the plants. It may be used, with
care, by those whose crop is not large enough to warrant
purchase of a spraying outfit.</p>

<p>“All of these appliances or applications, covers, Bordeaux
mixture or lime, merely protect the young plants
until they are strong enough to stand the injury from the
beetles; they do not kill the insects. To do this, trap crops
are needed. As the squash is the beetle’s favorite food
plant, this vegetable should be planted&mdash;in single rows
along the margins of small patches, in several rows around
large fields&mdash;about four days before the Cucumbers or
melon seeds are sown. When these trap plants are up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the beetles appear about them, dust about half the plants
with green arsenite, reserving the other half for use if rain
or heavy dew makes the poison soluble and kills the vines
first treated. The beetles, attracted by their favorite tidbit,
will feed upon the squash vines and be poisoned by the
arsenite. When the Cucumbers or melons are up, unless
they are protected by covers, spray with Bordeaux, and poison
more of the squash vines. When the beetles commence
to pair, the squashes may be cultivated up, leaving only a
few vines for the beetles to feed upon at flowering time, as
the insects prefer the squash flowers and will not molest the
others. Beans may be used with some success as a fall
catch crop, where wild flowers are not too plentiful. They
should be planted on the Cucumber or melon fields; and
when the beetles leave the old vines to feed upon the fresh
bean plants, they should be treated to liberal doses of poison
as well.”</p>

<p>The mildew on the vines can be prevented by Bordeaux
mixture spray.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 133px;">
<img src="images/083-currants.jpg" width="133" height="158" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Currants</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="currant" id="currant"></a>Currants.</b> The Currant, being one of the
hardiest and most productive of fruits, is often neglected,
the patch allowed to become foul with grass, never
thinned or trimmed, the worms eating the leaves until, in
the course of time, the plants weaken and die.
Along the fence is no place to plant Currants, or,
indeed, any other fruit; plant out in the open, at
least 5 feet from anything that will interfere with
cultivation. No fruit crop will respond more readily
to good care than the Currant. Clean cultivation
and a liberal use of manure or fertilizers
will certainly be followed by well paying crops.
One- or two-year-old plants may be set 4 by 6
feet. Trim the bush by cutting off most of the suckers
below the surface of the ground. If the season is dry, a
mulch of straw or leaves will assist the plants to establish
themselves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
The red and white Currants bear mostly on two-year-old
or older wood. A succession of young shoots should be
allowed to grow to take the place of the old bearing wood.
Cut out the canes as they grow older. The partial shade
afforded by a young orchard suits the Currant well, and if
the ground is in good condition no bad results will follow to
the orchard, provided the Currants are removed before the
trees need the entire feeding space.</p>

<p>A Currant patch should continue in good bearing for 10
to 20 years, if properly handled. One very important point
is to keep the old, weak canes cut out, and a succession of
two to four new ones coming from the root each year. For
home use, White Imperial and Moore’s Ruby are excellent.
Prince of Wales is a heavy bearer and excellent for cooking.
Wilder, Victoria, Cherry and White Grape are meritorious
varieties.</p>

<p>To combat the Currant worm, spray thoroughly with
Paris green to kill the first brood, just as soon as holes can
be seen in the lower leaves&mdash;usually before the plants are
in bloom. For the second brood, if it appear, spray with
white hellebore. For borers, cut out and burn the affected
canes.</p>

<p><b>Cuttings.</b> Cuttings are parts of plants which
are inserted in soil or water with the intention that they
shall grow and make new plants. They are of various kinds.
They may be classified, with reference to the age of the
wood or tissue, into two classes; viz., those made from
perfectly hard or dormant wood (taken from the winter
twigs of trees and bushes), and those made from more or
less immature or growing wood. They may be classified
again in respect to the part of the plants from which they
are taken, as root Cuttings, tuber Cuttings (as the ordinary
“seed” planted for potatoes), stem Cuttings and leaf Cuttings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 199px;">
<img src="images/085-cuttings.jpg" width="199" height="168" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">The planting of dormant wood
Cuttings</p>
</div>

<p>Dormant wood Cuttings are used for grapes, currants,
gooseberries, willows, poplars and many other kinds of soft-wooded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
trees and shrubs. Cuttings are ordinarily taken in
fall or winter, but cut into the proper lengths and then
buried in sand or moss where they do not freeze, in order
that the lower end may heal over or callus.
In the spring these Cuttings are
set in the ground, preferably in a rather
sandy and well drained place. Usually,
hardwood Cuttings are made with two to
four joints or buds, and when they are
planted, only the upper bud projects
above the ground. They may be planted
erect, as the picture shows, or somewhat
slanting. In order that the Cutting may
reach down to moist earth, it is desirable
that it should not be less than 6 inches long; and it is
sometimes better if it is 8 to 12 inches. If the wood is
short-jointed, there may be several buds on a Cutting of
this length; and, in order to prevent too many shoots from
arising from these buds, the lowermost buds are often cut
out. Roots will start as readily if the lower buds are removed,
since the buds grow into shoots and not into roots.
Cuttings of currants, grapes, gooseberries, and the like may
be set in rows which are far enough apart to admit of easy
tillage either with horse or hand tools, and the Cuttings
may be placed from 3 to 8 inches apart in the
row. After the Cuttings have grown for one season,
the plants are usually transplanted and given more
room for the second year’s growth, after which time
they are ready to be set in permanent plantations.
In some cases, the plants are set at the end of the
first year; but two-year plants are stronger and usually
preferable.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 96px;">
<img src="images/085-cuttings2.jpg" width="96" height="155" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Root Cutting,
which has given
rise to a shoot</p>
</div>

<p>Root Cuttings are used for blackberries, raspberries,
and a few other things. They are ordinarily made of
roots from the size of a lead pencil to one’s little finger, and
are cut in lengths from 3 to 5 inches long. The Cuttings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
are stored the same as stem Cuttings and allowed to callus.
In the spring they are planted in a horizontal or
nearly horizontal position in moist, sandy soil, being entirely
covered to a depth of 1 or 2 inches.</p>

<p>Softwood or greenwood Cuttings are always rooted under
cover; that is, in a greenhouse, coldframe or dwelling
house. They are usually made of wood which is mature
enough to break when it is bent sharply. When the wood
is so soft that it will bend and not break, it is too immature,
in the majority of plants, for the making of good Cuttings.
One to two joints is the proper length of a greenwood Cutting.
If of two joints, the lower leaf should be cut off and
the upper leaves cut in two, so that they do not present
their entire surface to the air and thereby evaporate the
plant juices too rapidly. If the Cutting is of only one joint,
the lower end is usually cut just above a joint. In either
case, the Cuttings are usually inserted in sand or well
washed gravel, nearly or quite up to the leaves. Keep the
bed uniformly moist throughout its depth, but avoid any soil
which holds so much moisture that it becomes muddy and
sour. These Cuttings should be shaded until they begin to
emit their roots. Coleus, geraniums, fuchsias, and nearly
all the common greenhouse and house plants, are propagated
by these Cuttings or slips.</p>

<p>Leaf Cuttings are often used, for the fancy-leaved begonias,
gloxinias, and a few other plants. The young plant
usually arises most readily from the leaf-stalk or petiole.
The leaf, therefore, is inserted into the ground much as a
green Cutting is. Begonia leaves, however, will throw out
young plants from the main veins when these veins or
ribs are cut. Therefore, well-grown and firm begonia leaves
are sometimes laid flat on the sand and the main veins cut;
then the leaf is weighted down with pebbles or pegs so that
these cut surfaces come into intimate contact with the soil
beneath. The begonia leaf may be treated in various other
ways and still give good results. <a href="#begonias">See <i>Begonia</i>.</a></p>

<p class="caption">Cuttings inserted in a
double pot</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
In the growing of all greenwood Cuttings, it is well to
remember that they should have a gentle bottom heat; the
soil should be such that it will hold moisture and yet not
remain wet; the air about the tops should not become close
and stagnant, else the plants will damp off; and the tops
should be shaded for a time.</p>

<p>An excellent method of starting Cuttings
in the living room is to make a double pot,
as shown in the picture. Inside a 6-inch pot,
set a 4-inch pot. Fill the bottom, <i>a</i>, with
gravel or bits of brick, for drainage. Plug the
hole in the inside pot. Fill the spaces between,
<i>c</i>, with earth, and in this set the Cuttings.
Water may be poured into the inner pot, <i>b</i>, to
supply the moisture.</p>

<p><b>Cutworms.</b> Probably the remedy for Cutworms
most often practiced in gardens, and which cannot
fail to be effective when faithfully carried out, is hand-picking
with lanterns at night or digging them out from around
the base of the infested plants during the day. Bushels of
Cutworms have been gathered in this way, and with profit.
When from some cause success does not attend the use of
the poisoned baits, discussed next, hand-picking is the only
other method yet recommended which can be relied upon to
check Cutworm depredations.</p>

<p>By far the best methods yet devised for killing Cutworms in
any situation are the poisoned baits; hand-picking is usually
unnecessary where they are thoroughly used. Poisoned
bunches of clover or weeds have been thoroughly tested,
even by the wagon-load, over large areas, and nearly
all have reported them very effective; lamb’s quarters
(pigweed), pepper-grass and mullein are among the weeds
especially attractive to Cutworms. On small areas the
making of the baits is done by hand, but they have been
prepared on a large scale by spraying the plants in the
field, cutting them with a scythe or machine, and pitching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
them from wagons in small bunches wherever desired.
Distributed a few feet apart between rows of garden plants
at nightfall, they have attracted and killed enough Cutworms
often to save a large proportion of the crop; if the
bunches can be covered with a shingle, they will keep
fresher much longer. The fresher the baits, and the more
thoroughly the baiting is done, the more Cutworms one can
destroy. However, it may sometimes happen that a sufficient
quantity of such green succulent plants cannot be obtained
early enough in the season in some localities. In
this case, and we are not sure but in all cases, the poisoned
bran mash can be used to the best advantage. It is easily
made and applied at any time, is not expensive, and thus
far the results show that it is a very attractive and effective
bait. A tablespoonful can be quickly dropped around the
base of each cabbage or tomato plant, small amounts can be
easily scattered along the rows of onions, turnips, etc., or
a little dropped on a hill of corn, cucumbers, etc. It was
used on sweet potato hills in New Jersey last year, and
“served as a complete protection, the Cutworms preferring
the bran.” It is well to apply it on the evening
of the day the plants are set out.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 174px;">
<img src="images/088-cutworm.jpg" width="174" height="227" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Protection from cutworms</p>
</div>

<p>The best time to apply these poisoned
baits is two or three days before any plants
have come up or been set out in the garden.
If the ground has been properly prepared, the
worms will have had but little to eat for several
days and they will thus seize the first
opportunity to appease their hunger upon the
baits, and wholesale destruction will result.
The baits should always be applied at this time
wherever Cutworms are expected. But it is
not too late usually to save most of a crop after the pests
have made their presence known by cutting off some of the
plants. Act promptly and use the baits freely.&mdash;<i>M. V.
Slingerland.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Cutworms may be kept away from plants by making a
collar of stiff paper or tin about the base, as in the picture;
but this is not practicable on a large scale.</p>

<p><b>Cyclamen.</b> A tender greenhouse tuberous
plant, sometimes seen in the window-garden. Cyclamens may
be grown from seed sown in April or September in soil containing
a large proportion of sand and leaf-mold. If sown
in September, they should be wintered in a coolhouse. In
May they should be potted into larger pots and placed in a
shaded frame, and by July will have become large enough
for their flowering pot, which should be either a 5- or
6-inch one. They should be brought into the house before
danger of frost, and grown cool until through flowering. A
temperature of 55° suits them while in flower. After
flowering, they will need a rest for a short time, but should
not become very dry, or the bulb will be injured. When
they start into growth, they should have the old soil shaken
off and be potted into smaller pots. At no time should more
than half the tuber be under the soil.</p>

<p>Tubers large enough to flower the first year may be obtained
from the seedsmen at moderate prices; and unless
one has facilities for growing the seedlings for a year, purchase
of the tubers will give the best satisfaction. The soil
best suited to the Cyclamen is one containing two parts
leaf-mold, 1 part each of sand and loam.</p>

<p><a name="D" id="D"></a><b>Daffodils</b> are a kind of Narcissus. They are
hardy, and require the treatment recommended for Crocus.
They may be naturalized in the grass, but they usually do
not persist long on account of our hot, dry summers. Daffodils
have been much improved of late. Plant in the fall,
4-6 in. deep. Excellent old garden plants.</p>

<p><b>Dahlia.</b> The Dahlia is an old favorite which,
on account of its formal flowers, has been in disfavor for a
few years, although it has always held a place in the rural
districts. Now, however, with the advent of the cactus and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
semi-cactus types (or loose-flowered forms), and the improvement
of the singles, it again has taken a front rank
among late summer flowers, coming in just in advance of
the Chrysanthemum.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 102px;">

<p class="caption">Dahlia</p>
</div>

<p>The single varieties may be grown from seed, but the
double sorts should be grown from cuttings of young
stems or from division of the roots. If cuttings are
to be made, it will be necessary to start the roots early
either in a hotbed or house. When the growth has
reached 4 or 5 inches, they may be cut from the plant
and rooted in sand. Care should be taken to cut just
below the joint, as a cutting made between two joints
will not form tubers. The most rapid method of propagation
of named varieties is to grow from cuttings
in this way. In growing the plants from roots, the best
plan is to place the whole root in gentle heat, covering
slightly. When the young growth has started, the roots
may be taken up, divided, and planted out 3 to 4 feet apart.
This plan will ensure a plant from each piece of root,
whereas if the roots are divided while dormant, there is
danger of not having a bud at the end of each
piece, in which case no growth will start.</p>

<p class="caption">Dahlia</p>
</div>

<p>The Dahlia flourishes best in a deep, rich,
moist soil, although very good results can be had
on sandy soil, provided plant-food and moisture
are furnished. Clay should be avoided. If the
plants are to be grown without stakes, the center
of each plant should be pinched out after making
two or three joints. By doing this the lateral
branches will start near the ground and be stiff enough to
withstand the winds. In most home gardens the plants are
allowed to reach their full height, and are tied to stakes if
necessary. Dahlias are very susceptible to frost. The tall
kinds reach a height of 5-8 feet.</p>

<p>After the first frost, lift the roots, let them dry in the
sun, shake off the dirt, trim off tops and broken parts, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
store them in a cellar as you would potatoes. Cannas may
be stored in the same place.</p>

<p><b><a name="daisy" id="daisy"></a>Daisy.</b> The perennial English Daisy, or <i>Bellis
perennis</i>, is a prime favorite as an edging plant. The cheerful
little flowers show early in the spring, and with a little
care bloom continuously through a long season. They
should be given well enriched, moist soil, and be mulched
through hot weather. The usual method of propagation is
by division of the crowns, made in cool weather. They may
also be grown from seed, but the chances are that many inferior
flowers will be produced. Set the plants 3 or 4 inches
apart. Height 3 to 5 inches. The colors are white, pink and
red. Hardy if mulched in winter, but best results are obtained
if plants are renewed frequently.</p>

<p>Many other plants are called Daisy, particularly the wild
Asters, the Ox-eye Daisy or Whiteweed, and the Paris Daisy
(<i>Chrysanthemum frutescens</i>).</p>

<p><b>Damping Off</b> is the rotting off of cuttings or
young plants near the surface of the soil. It is the work of
fungi; but these fungi are injurious because they find conditions
congenial to their rapid growth. Prevention is
worth more than cure. See that the soil is wet clear
through, not wet on top and dry beneath. Keep it as dry as
possible on the surface. Avoid soggy soils. On peaty soils,
sprinkle sand or coal ashes to keep the top dry. Give the
plants free circulation of air. Give them abundance of
room. If Damping Off threatens, transplant.</p>

<p><b>Dandelion.</b> This common weed would hardly
be recognized if seen under cultivation in the vegetable
garden. The plants attain a large size and the leaves are
much more tender. The seed may be selected from the
best field-growing plants, but it is better to buy the French
seed of the seedsmen.</p>

<p>Sow in spring in well manured soil, either in drills or in
hills 1 foot apart. A cutting of leaves may be had in September<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
or October, and some of the stools may stand until
spring. The delicacy of the leaves may be improved by
blanching them, either by the use of boards or earth. One
trade packet of seed will supply a large number of plants.
The whole plant is destroyed when the crop of leaves is taken.</p>

<p><b>Datura.</b> <span class="smcap">Brugmansia.</span> Large-growing annuals
with large, trumpet-shaped flowers. The coloring of
some of the flowers is very attractive, but the odor of the
plant is unpleasant. Plants should be set 4 feet apart.
They grow 3-4 feet high, bear large leaves, and therefore
make good low screens. Frost kills them. Sow seed where
plants are to grow; or, better, start them in the house three
or four weeks before the weather is fit for planting outside.
Some of the Daturas are weeds. The great spiny
seed pods are interesting.</p>

<p class="caption">Lucretia Dewberry</p>
</div>

<p><b>Dewberry.</b> The Dewberry may be called an
early trailing blackberry. The culture of this, as of the
blackberry, is very simple; but, unlike the latter, some
support should be given to the canes, as they are very
slender and rank growers. A wire trellis or
large-meshed fence-wire answers admirably;
or (and this is the better general method) they
may be tied to stakes. The fruits are large and
showy, which, combined with their earliness,
makes them desirable; but they are usually
deficient in flavor. The Lucretia is the leading
variety in cultivation.</p>

<p>Lay the canes on the ground in winter. In
the spring tie all the canes from each plant to a stake.
After fruiting, cut the old canes and burn them (as for
blackberries). In the meantime, the young canes (for next
year’s fruiting) are growing. These may be tied up as they
grow, to be out of the way of the cultivator. Dewberries
are one to two weeks earlier than blackberries.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
<b><a name="dianthus" id="dianthus"></a>Dianthus</b>, or <span class="smcap">Pink</span>. Under this head are included
Chinese Pinks, Sweet William, Picotee, Carnation
(<a href="#carnations">which see</a>), and the perennial or Grass Pinks. All of
them are general favorites.</p>

<p>The Chinese Pinks (<i>Dianthus Chinensis</i>, or <i>Heddewigii</i>) are
now very popular. They are biennials, but flower the first
year from seed, and are treated as hardy annuals. They have
a wide range of color and markings. Some of them are as
double as a rose, and are edged, splashed or lined with other
colors. The single ones are very brilliant and are profuse
bloomers. Sow seeds where plants are to stand, or if early
bloom is desired, start in the house. Set the plants 6-10
in. apart. They grow 8-15 in. high. They bloom until after
frost. Of easiest culture in any good soil, and should be
even more popular. The petals are often quite deeply and
oddly cut.</p>

<p>The Sweet William is an old-fashioned perennial, having
flowers of many combinations of color, growing for several
years when once planted, but being the better for renewal
every two years. Raising new stock from seeds is usually
better than dividing old plants. Of late years, the Sweet
William has been much improved.</p>

<p>The perennial garden or Grass Pinks are low-growing,
with highly perfumed flowers. They are very useful for
permanent edgings, although the grass is likely to run them
out unless a clean strip is kept on either side. Divide the
old plants when the edging begins to fail; or
raise new plants from seed. Seedlings usually
do not bloom much the first year. Usually perfectly
hardy.</p>

<p class="caption">Dibbers</p>
</div>

<p><b>Dibbers</b> are hand tools used for making
holes in which to set plants or to drop
seeds. They are better than a hoe or a spade
for most transplanting. For small plants, as cabbages and
tomatoes, a cylindrical Dibber is generally used. (See the
lower one in the cut.) It can be made from an old spade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
handle or any hardwood stick. When broad holes are
wanted, the triangular iron Dibber (sold by dealers) is excellent.
It is particularly useful in hard soils.</p>

<p><b>Dicentra</b> includes the Bleeding Heart; also
the native little Dutchman’s Breeches and Squirrel Corn,
and a few other species. All are hardy perennials of
the easiest culture, blooming in spring. In common with
all perennial herbs, they are benefited by a winter mulch of
leaves or litter. Propagated by dividing the clumps.</p>

<p><b><a name="dictamnus" id="dictamnus"></a>Dictamnus.</b> <span class="smcap">Fraxinella</span> or <span class="smcap">Gas Plant</span>. An
old border plant (perennial herb) with white or pale red
flowers. The leaves of the plant emit a strong odor when
rubbed, likened to that of the lemon verbena. It has been
advertised as the Gas Plant from the fact that the plant
exudes an oily matter that may be ignited, especially in
warm, dry weather. Propagated by seeds, which should be
sown as soon as ripe. The plant blooms the third year,
and improves with age. Set plants 3 feet apart. Height 2
to 3 feet.</p>

<p><b>Dill.</b> An annual aromatic herb that will seed
itself if seeds are left to ripen, and an abundance of plants
may always be had. The culture is of the easiest. The
seeds are often used to flavor pickles.</p>

<p><b>Diseases.</b> Diseases of plants may be caused
by some physiological disturbance to the plant system, or by
the incursions of some parasitic organism, as insects or fungi.
The work of insects, however, is ordinarily not classed with
plant Diseases (<a href="#insects">see <i>Insects</i></a>). Of Diseases which are caused
by plant parasites or by physiological disturbances, there
are two general groups:</p>

<p>(1) Parasitic fungous Diseases, such as the apple-scab,
black-rot and mildew of the grape, leaf-blight of the plum
and pear, black-knot, and the like. These Diseases are
characterized by definite spots, discolorations or excrescences,
which are more or less scattered over the surface of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the leaf, fruit or branch. As a rule, the leaves and fruits
which are attacked have a tendency to drop from the tree.
The general treatment for these Diseases is to spray with
some fungicidal mixture, like the Bordeaux mixture or the
ammoniacal carbonate of copper. The treatment is useful
in proportion as it is applied early and thoroughly. After
the fungus once gets into the tissues of the host-plant, it is
difficult, if not impossible, to kill it. If, however, the fungicide
is upon the plant before the fungus is, the parasite
may not be able to obtain a foothold. Even after it does
obtain a foothold, it is probable, however, that the spray
will check its spread by preventing the development of its
external parts.</p>

<p>(2) The physiological and bacterial Diseases, or those
which are termed constitutional troubles. In these cases
there are rarely any definite spots, as in the attacks of
parasitic fungi, but the entire leaf, or even the entire plant,
or a large part of it, shows a general weakening and Disease,
as if there were some cutting off of the accustomed
source of nourishment. Such Diseases are very likely to be
seen in a general yellowing and death of the leaf, in the
dying of the leaf along the main veins and around the
edges, showing that the difficulty is one which affects the
entire leaf, and not any particular part of it. In general,
there is a tendency for the foliage in plants so attacked to
wither up and hang on the tree for a time. The peach-yellows
and pear blight are Diseases of this kind. There
are no specific treatments for troubles of this sort. They
must be approached by what physicians call prophylaxis&mdash;that
is, by methods of sanitation and prevention. The diseased
plants or parts are cut away and burned. All those
conditions which seem to favor the development of the Disease
are removed. Varieties which are particularly susceptible
are discarded. Careful management in matters of
this sort is often much more important than any attempt at
specific treatment.</p>

<b>Dolichos.</b> <a href="#hyacinth_bean">Mentioned under <i>Hyacinth Bean</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Dracænas</b> of the conservatories (properly
mostly <span class="smcap">Cordylines</span>) are sometimes used as house plants.
Protect from direct sunlight, keep an even and fairly high
temperature, water freely when they are growing. When
the plants begin to fail, return them to the florist for recuperation,
where they may have equable conditions. They
are handsome long-leaved foliage plants, excellent for
jardinieres.</p>

<p><b>Drainage</b> serves two purposes: first, to carry
superfluous water from the land; second, to lower the water-table
or hard-pan, and to make the soil loose and friable
above. Nearly all hard clay lands are much benefited by
draining, even though they are not too wet. The region of
free or standing water is lowered and air is admitted into
the soil, rendering it fine and mellow. For carrying off
mere surface water, surface or open ditches are sufficient;
but if the soil is to be ameliorated, the drain must be beneath
the surface. The best underdrains are those which
use hollow or cylindrical tiles, but very good results may be
had by making drains from stones. In regions where there
are many flat stones, a very good conduit may be laid with
them, but they are likely to get out of order. If there is
considerable fall to the ditch, the bottom may be filled for
the space of 10 inches or a foot with common stones rolled
in, and the water will find its way between them. If the
stones are even deeper than this, the results will be better;
and such ditches also provide place for disposing of superfluous
stones.</p>

<p>The deeper the ditch the further it will draw on either
side. It should always be deep enough to be protected from
freezing, particularly if tiles are used. Three feet should
be the least depth, and 3½ feet is a good average depth.
Drains as deep as this need not be placed oftener than 2 to 3
rods apart, unless, in garden conditions, it is desired to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
very thoroughly ameliorate a heavy clay soil, in which case
they may be placed every 20 feet. The better the fall
the quicker the drain will act and the more permanent it will
be, as it will tend to clean itself and not fill up with silt.
It is important that the outlet be entirely free, and it should
be protected with stones or mason work. The roots of some
trees, particularly of willows and elms, are attracted by tile
drains, and often fill up the pipes. When the drain goes
near such trees, therefore, it is well to cement the joints.
In general practice, however, the joints should not be
cemented, because a large part of the drainage water enters
at those places. In laying the tiles, it is well to cover the
joints with inverted sod, tarred paper, wisps of straw,
stones or other material. This prevents the fresh earth
from falling in between the joints, and by the time the material
is decayed the earth will have become so thoroughly
set that no further trouble will result. Although under-drains
take off superfluous water, nevertheless an under-drained
soil will hold more moisture than one which is not
drained, particularly in the case of clay lands with high
subsoils. This is because fine, mallow soils are able to hold
more moisture than very loose and open or very dense and
compact ones. A well constructed underdrain should last
indefinitely.</p>

<p><a name="E" id="E"></a><b>Echeveria.</b> Tender succulents largely used for
carpet bedding and rock gardens. <i>Echeveria secunda</i> is sometimes
called <span class="smcap">Old-Hen-and-Chickens</span>, from the little plants
that grow out from the stem of the parent plant and show
around the edges of the rosette top; but the hardy Hen-and-Chickens
of old gardens is a different but closely allied
plant (<i>Sempervivum tectorum</i>). All the species are of easy
culture and thrive on sandy soil. They should not be
planted out until all danger of frost is over and the ground
thoroughly warm. Propagated by the offsets. Height 3<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
inches. The name Echeveria is now given up by botanists
for <i>Cotyledon</i>.</p>

<p><b>Egg-plant.</b> <span class="smcap">Guinea Squash.</span> Unless one has
a greenhouse or a very warm hotbed, the growing of Egg-plants
in the North should be left to the professional gardener,
as the young plants are very tender, and should be
grown without a check. The seed should be sown in the
hotbed or greenhouse about April 10, keeping a temperature
of from 65° to 70°. When the seedlings have made three
rough leaves, they may be pricked out into shallow boxes,
or, still better, into 3-inch pots. The pots or boxes should
be plunged to the rim in soil in a hotbed or coldframe so
situated that protection may be given on chilly nights. The
10th of June is early enough to plant them out in central
New York. The soil in which they are to grow cannot well
be made too rich, as they have only a short season in which
to develop their fruits. The plants are usually set 3 feet
apart each way. A dozen plants are sufficient
for the needs of a large family, as each plant
should yield from two to six large fruits. The
fruits are fit to eat at all stages of growth, from
those the size of a large egg to their largest
development. One ounce of seed will furnish
600 to 800 plants.</p>

excellent.</p>

<p><b>Endive.</b> As a fall salad vegetable, this should
be better known, it being far superior to lettuce at that

sown from June to August, and as the plants become fit to
eat about the same time from sowing as lettuce does, a succession
may be had until cold weather. The plants will
need protection from the severe fall frosts, and this may be
given by carefully lifting the plants and transplanting to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
frame, where sash or cloth may be used to cover them in
freezing weather. The leaves, which constitute practically
the whole plant, are blanched before being used, either by
tying together with some soft material or by standing boards
on each side of the row, allowing the top of the boards to
meet over the center of the row. The rows should be 1½
or 2 feet apart, the plants 1 foot apart in the rows. One
ounce of seed will sow 150 feet of drill.</p>

<p><b>Eschscholtzia.</b> <a href="#california_poppy">See <i>California Poppy</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Eutoca.</b> Hardy early-flowering annuals having
pink or blue flowers, good for masses. Sow seed early
where wanted. Height 1 foot. Eutocas are properly classed
with Phacelias.</p>

<p><b>Evergreens.</b> Evergreens are plants which hold
their foliage in winter. Ordinarily, however, in this country
the word Evergreen is understood to mean coniferous
trees with persistent leaves, as pines, spruces, firs, cedars,
junipers, arborvitæ, retinosporas, and the like. These trees
have always been favorites with plant lovers, as they have
very distinctive forms and other characteristics. Many of
them are of the easiest culture. It is a common notion that,
since spruces and other conifers grow so symmetrically,
they will not stand pruning; but this is an error. They
may be pruned with as good effect as other trees, and if
they tend to grow too tall the leader may be cut out without
fear. A new leader will arise, but in the meantime the
upward growth of the tree will be somewhat checked, and
the effect will be to make the tree dense. The tips of
the branches may also be headed in with the same effect. The
beauty of an Evergreen lies in its natural form; therefore,
it should not be sheared into unusual shapes, but a gentle
trimming back, as suggested, will tend to prevent the Norway
spruce and others from growing open and ragged.
After the tree attains some age, 4 or 5 inches may be taken
off the ends of the main branches every year or two with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
good results. This slight trimming is ordinarily done with
Waters’ long-handled pruning shears.</p>

<p>There is much difference of opinion as to the proper time
for the transplanting of Evergreens, which means that there
is more than one season in which they may be moved. It
is ordinarily unsafe to transplant them in the fall in northern
climates or bleak situations, since the evaporation from
the foliage during the winter is likely to injure the plant.
The best results are usually secured when they are transplanted
just as new growth is beginning, rather late in the
spring. Some people also plant them in August, and the
roots secure a hold of the soil before winter. In transplanting
conifers, it is very important that the roots be not exposed
to the sun. They should be moistened and covered
with burlaps or other material. The holes should be ready
to receive them. If the trees are large, or if it has been
necessary to trim in the roots, the top should be cut when
the tree is set. Large Evergreens (those 10 feet and more
high) are usually best transplanted late in winter, at a time
when a large ball of earth may be moved with them. A
trench is dug around the tree, it being deepened a little day
by day so that the frost can work into the earth and hold it
in shape. When the ball is thoroughly frozen, it is hoisted
onto a stone-boat and moved to its new position.</p>

<p>For low hedges or screens, one of the most serviceable
Evergreens is the arborvitæ in its various forms. Red cedars
are also useful. Perhaps the handsomest of all of them
for such purposes is the ordinary hemlock spruce; but it is
usually difficult to move. Transplanted trees from nurseries
are usually safest. If the trees are taken from the wild,
they should be selected from open and sunny places. For
neat and compact effects near porches and along walks, the
dwarf retinosporas are very useful. Most of the pines and
spruces are too coarse for planting very close to the house.
They are better at some distance removed, where they serve
as a background to other planting. If they are wanted for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
individual specimens, they should be given plenty of room,
so that the limbs will not be crowded and the tree become
misshapen. Whatever else is done to the spruces and firs,
the lower limbs should not be trimmed up, at least not until
the tree has become so old that the lowest branches die.
Some species hold their branches much longer than others.
The oriental spruce (<i>Picea orientalis</i>) is one of the best in
this respect. The occasional slight heading-in, which we
have mentioned, will tend to preserve the lower limbs, and
it will not be marked enough to alter the form of the tree.</p>

<p><b><a name="everlastings" id="everlastings"></a>Everlastings</b> are flowers which retain their
shape and usually their color when they are dried. Most of
them are members of the composite family. In order to
have them hold shape and color, cut them with very long
stems just before they are fully expanded, and hang them in
an airy place away from the sun. They are all annuals, or
grown as such, and are of very easy culture. Sow seeds
where the plants are to stand. Good kinds are Ammobium,
Gomphrena or Bachelor’s Buttons, Rhodanthe, Helichrysum,
Xeranthemum, and Acroclinium. Certain wild
composites may be similarly used, particularly Anaphalis
and species of Gnaphalium. Some of the grasses make
excellent additions to dry bouquets (<a href="#grass">see <i>Grass</i></a>). With these
dry bouquets, various seed pods look well.</p>

<p><a name="F" id="F"></a><b>Fenzlia.</b> Little hardy annuals, having a profusion
of bloom through the entire summer. The flowers are
a delicate pink, with yellow throat surrounded by dark
spots. A charming edging plant or window box subject.
Sow the seed in boxes or where plants are wanted, and thin
to the distance of 10 inches. Height 3 to 4 inches. Now
classed with Gilia.</p>

<p><b>Ferns.</b> Probably the one Fern grown most
extensively as a house plant is the small-leaved Maidenhair
Fern (or <i>Adiantum gracillimum</i>). This and other species are
among the finest of house plants, when sufficient moisture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
can be given. They make fine specimens, as well as serving
the purpose of greenery for cut-flowers. Other species
often grown for house plants are <i>A. cuneatum</i> and <i>A.
Capillus-Veneris</i>. All these do well in a mixture of fibrous
sod, loam, and sand, with ample drainage material. They
may be divided if an increase is wanted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/102-fern.jpg" width="165" height="174" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Boston Fern</p>
</div>

<p>Other Ferns for house culture include
<i>Nephrolepis exaltata</i>. This is no doubt the
most easily grown of the list, flourishing in
a sitting-room. The new variety of <i>N. exaltata</i>,
called the Boston Fern (see figure),
is a decided addition to this family, having a
drooping habit, covering the pot and making
a fine stand or bracket plant.</p>

<p>Several species of Pteris, particularly <i>P.
serrulata</i>, are valuable house Ferns, but require
a warmer situation than those mentioned above. They
will also thrive better in a shady or ill-lighted corner.</p>

<p>Perfect drainage and care in watering have more to do
with the successful growing of Ferns than any special mixture
of soils. If the drainage material in the bottom of the
pot or box is sufficient, there is little danger of over-watering;
but water-logged soil is always to be avoided.
Do not use clay soils. Ferns need protection from the direct
sunshine, and also a moist atmosphere. They thrive
well in a close glass box, or window-garden, if the conditions
can be kept equable.</p>

<p>The native Ferns transplant easily to the garden, and
they make an attractive addition to the side of a house, or
as an admixture in a hardy border. The Ostrich and Cinnamon
Ferns are the best subjects. Give all outdoor Ferns
a place which is protected from winds, otherwise they will
shrivel and perhaps die. Screen them from the hot sun,
or give them the shady side of the building. See that the
soil is uniformly moist, and that it does not get too hot.
Mulch with leaf-mold in the fall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<b><a name="fertilizers" id="fertilizers"></a>Fertilizers.</b> Soil is productive when it has
good physical texture, plant-food, and a sufficient supply of
moisture. Even though it has an abundance of plant-food,
if its texture is not good, it will not raise a good crop.
Soil has good texture when it is open, mellow, friable,
rather than loose and leachy, or hard and cloddy. Commercial
Fertilizers add plant-food, but usually they have only a
small influence in correcting faulty texture. Therefore,
before concentrated Fertilizers are applied to land, it should
be gotten into good physical condition by judicious tillage
and by the incorporation of vegetable mold or humus. The
leading source of humus in most gardens is stable manure.
<a href="#manure">See <i>Manure</i>.</a></p>

<p>The plant-food in commercial Fertilizers is largely in a
soluble or quickly available condition. Therefore, a little
Fertilizer applied late in the fall or early in the spring will
tend to start the plants off quickly in the spring and to
cause them to become established before the trying weather
of summer. For garden purposes, it is usually advisable to
buy one of the so-called complete Fertilizers; that is, one
which contains nitrogen, potash and phosphoric acid. If a
luxuriant growth of stalk and foliage is wanted rather than
flowers or fruit, an application of nitrogen alone is usually
advisable. The most readily available nitrogen in commercial
form is that which is afforded by nitrate of soda and
sulfate of ammonia. In garden practice this may be applied
at the rate of 300 to 400 pounds an acre, although this
quantity is more than is profitable to use in most general
field or agricultural conditions. If it is desired to have
stout, stocky plants, with early and profuse bloom, it is
ordinarily advisable to use somewhat sparingly of nitrogen
and to use a little more heavily of potash and phosphoric
acid. This is especially true of the leguminous plants,
which have the power of appropriating atmospheric nitrogen,
and among such plants are sweet peas. Heavy fertilizing
of sweet pea land with strong stable manure tends to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
make the vines grow too tall and to bear comparatively few
flowers. For dressing of lawns, a Fertilizer which is comparatively
rich in nitrogen is usually to be advised.</p>

<p>An important value of commercial Fertilizers is to use
them to start off the plants quickly in the spring. The food
is available and acts at once. When used for this purpose,
the Fertilizer may be applied in the hill; but when it is desired
for the enriching of the land and for the support of the
crop throughout the season, it should be applied to the entire
surface. Always avoid putting the Fertilizer on the
crown of the plant, or directly in contact with it. It is
usually better to work the Fertilizer in lightly. For most
garden operations, it is better to apply in spring.</p>

<p><b>Fig.</b> The Fig is little grown in the East
except as a curiosity, but on the Pacific coast it has
gained more or less prominence as an orchard fruit. The
trees are usually planted at distances of about 18 to 25 feet
apart. Figs will stand considerable frost, and seedling or
inferior varieties grow out of doors without protection as
far north as Virginia. Many of the varieties fruit on young
sprouts, and, inasmuch as the roots will stand considerable
cold, these varieties will often give a few Figs in the northern
states. Figs have been fruited in the open ground in
Michigan. In all frosty countries, however, the Fig should
be laid down during the winter time. The following notes
from Professor Massey, of North Carolina, indicate how this

<p>“The light hoar-frosts that have occurred here affected
vegetation only on low grounds, and today (November 5)
our gardens on high ground show no signs of frost. Lima
beans and tomato vines are as green as in summer time,
and this morning we gathered ripe Figs from our trees in
the garden&mdash;the latest I have ever known Figs to ripen.
As the early crop of Figs ripens in July (if it escapes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
winter frosts, for the fruit is now set on the trees), and the
late crop begins in August and continues to ripen in succession
till frost, it is easy to see what a desirable fruit the
Fig is. In this section it is easy to have a great abundance
of Figs, and it is possible almost anywhere in the
United States to have both early and late crops
in abundance by taking a little trouble to protect
the trees in winter. Years ago the writer grew
Figs in abundance in a very cold locality in
northern Maryland, and never failed
to get a good crop. Where the winter
temperature seldom drops lower than
18° or 20° above zero, Figs will need no special
protection if sheltered from cold winds. In
colder climates they should be branched from the
ground, and, after the leaves have fallen, be bent
to the ground in four bundles and covered with
earth, making a sharp mound over the center and
sloping off like a four-pointed star or cross, as shown in
the cuts, taken from Bulletin 74 of North Carolina Experiment
Station.”</p>

<p><b><a name="flower_beds" id="flower_beds"></a>Flower Beds.</b> Two classes of subjects are to
be considered in the discussion of Flower Beds: those concerned
with the location of the bed; those concerned with
the actual making of the bed itself. Most persons do not
consider the former subject. If one wants a flower garden in
which there is to be a collection of plants grown for the
plants’ sake, the garden should be placed at the rear or one
side, and may be laid out in regular fashion like a vegetable
garden. If the flowers are to be a part of the home picture,&mdash;that
is, a part of the place itself,&mdash;then they may be
freely distributed amongst the border planting, or as edgings
along groups of shrubbery. It is rarely, if ever, allowable
to place formal beds in the lawn in home grounds. The
place for carpet-bedding is usually in parks or other public
areas, in sections which are set aside and devoted to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
particular purpose, the same as another section may be devoted
to a zoölogical garden, play-ground or to other specific
use. Flowers which are grown in the middle of the
lawn have little relation to other planting, and they have no
background to show them off to good advantage. It is also
difficult to grow them in small beds in the grass, since they
are exposed to sun and wind, and the grass roots absorb the
food and moisture. In the formal bed, every effort must be
made to keep it prim, otherwise it becomes displeasing;
whereas, if the flowers are planted more or less promiscuously
in large, irregular borders, or along the edge of shrubbery,
the failure of one or even of a dozen plants is not a
serious matter. The growing of plants in formal designs
requires so much care and attention that a large part of the
fun of plant-growing is lost. Such plant-growing should
ordinarily be left to those who make a business of it.</p>

<p>In making a Flower Bed, see that the ground is well
drained; that the subsoil is deep; that the land is in a
mellow and friable condition, and that it is rich. Each fall
it may have a mulch of rotted manure or of leaf-mold, which
may be spaded under deeply in the spring; or the land may
be spaded and left rough in the fall, which is a good practice
when the soil has much clay. Make the Flower Beds as
broad as possible, so that the roots of the grass running in
from either side will not meet beneath the flowers and rob
them of food and moisture. It is well to add a little commercial
fertilizer each fall or spring.</p>

<p><b>Flowering Maple.</b> <a href="#abutilon">See <i>Abutilon</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Forget-me-not.</b> This old favorite grows so
easily, looks so cheerful, and with a little care will bloom
so long, that it should have a place in every collection of
flowering plants. It is perennial, but the best results may
be had by dividing the roots as often as every other year; or
seedlings may be taken up from around the old plants.
They require a moist soil, with shade a part of the day.
They will thrive exceedingly if grown in a frame like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
pansies. Easily grown from seeds, usually blooming the
first fall. Excellent for low edgings. Height 6 inches.</p>

<p><b>Four-o’clock.</b> <span class="smcap">Mirabilis.</span> Tender annual, a
plant of old-fashioned gardens, and always interesting.
Grows 2 to 3 feet high. Drop seeds where the plants are to
stand, thinning them to 12 to 18 inches apart. The colors
are white and pink. There are variegated-leaved forms;
also dwarfs. Excellent for the back row in a bed of
annuals.</p>

<img src="images/107-foxglove.jpg" width="87" height="247" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Foxglove</p>
</div>

<p><b>Foxglove</b>, or <span class="smcap">Digitalis</span>. Foxgloves make most
effective border plants, either as a background or planted
among other things. The tall flower-spikes are
covered during the blooming period with funnel-shaped
drooping flowers in various colors and with
fine markings. Some of the newer varieties have
flowers that rival the Gloxinias in shadings and markings.
The plants are perfectly hardy, growing in one
situation for a number of years; but, as with many
other perennials, they are all the better for being
divided at intervals. They may be grown readily from
seed. Sow in boxes under glass or in the border
where wanted. They bloom the second year. A rich,
deep soil and partial shade suit their requirements.
Period of bloom, July and August. Height 2 to 4 feet.</p>

<p><b>Frame.</b> See <a href="#hotbed"><i>Hotbed</i></a> and <a href="#coldframe"><i>Coldframe</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Freesia.</b> One of the best and most easily handled
winter-flowering bulbs. The white or yellowish bell-shaped
flowers are produced on slender stalks just above the foliage,
to the number of six to eight in a cluster. They are very
fragrant, and last for a considerable time when picked.
The bulbs are small, and look as though they could not
produce a growth of foliage and flowers, but even the
smallest mature bulb will prove satisfactory. Several
bulbs should be planted together in a pot, box or pan, in
October, if wanted for the holidays, or later if wanted at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Easter. The plants bloom from ten to twelve weeks from
planting, under ordinary care. No special treatment is required;
keep the plants cool and moist through the growing
season. The soil should contain a little sand mixed with
fibrous loam, and the pot should be well drained. After
flowering, gradually withhold water and the tops will die
down, after which the roots may be shaken out and rested
until time to plant in fall. Care should be taken to keep them
perfectly dry. The bulbs increase rapidly from offsets.
Plants may also be grown from seed, which should be sown
as soon as ripe, giving blooming plants the second or third
year. Height 12 or 15 inches. Easy to bloom in the window.
The white form (<i>Freesia refracta alba</i>) is the best.
<a href="#bulbs">See <i>Bulbs</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Fritillaria</b>, or <span class="smcap">Fritillary</span>. Bulbous plants,
the commoner species hardy. Only the Crown Imperial is
well known in this country. This is an old-fashioned plant,
which takes care of itself when once planted. The other
hardy Fritillarias are treated like tulips.</p>

<p><b><a name="frost" id="frost"></a>Frost.</b> The light frosts of late spring and of
early fall may be prevented by any means which will keep
the air in motion, or which will fill the air with moisture or
cloud-like vapor, so that there is less radiation from the
ground. When frost is expected, it is well to water the
plants and the ground thoroughly. This will ordinarily protect
them from two or three degrees of still frost. The water
should be applied just at nightfall. On larger areas, it is
often practicable to make a smudge. In order to be
effective, the smudge must be rather dense and lie over
the whole area, and it should be kept up until the danger
from frost is past. Material which burns very slowly and
with much smoke is preferable. Moist manure or straw or
other litter is useful. Materials which are dry enough to
blaze are of little use. Ordinarily, frost comes towards
morning. It is well to have the piles of rubbish ready at
nightfall and have them lighted toward the latter part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the night, when the frost is expected. The smudge should
be kept up until sunrise. It is well to have these piles of
smudge material on all sides of the area; or if the area is on
a slope, it may be sufficient to have them on the upper
side, for there is usually a movement of air down the hillside
and the area will thereby be covered with the smudge.
For a thorough protection, it is best to have many small
piles rather than a few large ones. If the piles are placed
every ten feet around the areas, better results are to be expected.
There are especially prepared tar-like materials
for use in smudging plantations, but they are little used in
this country, although some of them are excellent.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 236px;">
<img src="images/109-fuchsia.jpg" width="236" height="185" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Fuchsia</p>
</div>

<p><b>Fuchsia.</b> Well-known window or greenhouse
shrub. It is readily grown from cuttings. Soft, green wood
should be used for cuttings, and it will root in about three
weeks, when the cuttings should be potted. Take care not
to have them pot-bound while in growth, but do not
over-pot when bloom is wanted. Given warmth and good
soil, they will make fine plants in
three months or less. In well protected,
partially shady places they
may be planted out, growing into
miniature bushes by fall. Plants may
be kept on from year to year; and
if the branches are well cut back after
blooming, abundant new bloom will
come. But it is usually best to make
new plants each year from cuttings,
since young plants usually bloom most profusely and demand
less care. Fuchsias are amongst the best of window
subjects.</p>

<p><b>Fumigation</b> is mentioned under <a href="#insects"><i>Insects</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Fungi.</b> Flowerless, leafless plants, living mostly
on food (either living or dead) which has been prepared by
other plants or by animals, Molds, mushrooms and puff-balls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
are familiar examples. Some of the parasitic kinds
cause great damage to the plants or animals on which they
live. Examples of these injurious parasitic kinds are apple-scab
fungus, potato mildew, grape mildew, corn smut
fungus, and the like. Most of these are combated by
spraying with materials containing copper or sulfur.</p>

<p><b><a name="funkia" id="funkia"></a>Funkia</b>, or <span class="smcap">Day Lily</span>. Hardy perennial herbs,
growing in dense clumps and bearing attractive foliage.
They are of the easiest culture. <i>F. subcordata</i>, the white-flowered
species, is commonest. Of blue-flowered forms there
are several, of which <i>F. ovata</i> (or <i>F. cærulca</i>) is perhaps
the best. Funkias are excellent for borders, or as a formal
edging to long walks or drives. There are variegated forms.
Funkias grow 12 to 24 inches high, and the flower clusters
stand still higher. Propagated by dividing the roots. Day
Lily is a name applied also to species of Hemerocallis,
which are yellow-flowered lilies.</p>

<p><a name="G" id="G"></a><b>Gaillardias</b> are plants that should have a place
in every garden, either as border plants or for cutting. The
flowers are very showy and lasting in bouquets, as
well as on the plants. The double form has perfect
balls of color. Gaillardias are both annual and perennial.
The perennials usually have flowers much
larger than the annuals; and they bloom the first year
if seed is started early. These are also propagated by
seed or cuttings. If from seed, it should be sown
under glass in February or March, setting out the
young plants where wanted when danger of frost is
over. The cuttings may be made of the new growth
in the fall and wintered over in the house. Set 2 feet
apart. Height 2 feet, blooming from July until hard frosts.
The perennials are usually orange.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/110-gaillardia.jpg" width="75" height="168" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Gaillardia picta</p>
</div>

<p>The annual kind (<i>Gaillardia picta</i> of florists) is probably
the best kind for the home garden. It is of the
easiest culture. Hardy. Two feet. Sow seeds where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
plants are to bloom. The colors of the flowers are in
rich shades of yellow and red.</p>

<p><b>Galanthus.</b> <a href="#snowdrop">See <i>Snowdrop</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Garlic.</b> An onion-like plant, the bulbs of which
are used for flavoring. Little known in this country except
amongst those of foreign birth. It is multiplied the same
as multiplier onions&mdash;the bulb is broken apart and each
bulbule or “clove” makes a new compound bulb in a few
weeks. Hardy; plant in early spring, or in the South in
the fall. Plant 2 to 3 inches apart in the row.</p>

<p><b>Gas Plant</b> is <a href="#dictamnus"><i>Dictamnus</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Geranium.</b> What are generally known as
Geraniums are, strictly speaking, Pelargoniums, <a href="#pelargoniums">which see</a>.
The true Geraniums are mostly hardy plants, and therefore
should not be confounded with the tender Pelargoniums.
Geraniums are worthy a place in a border. They are
hardy perennials, and may be transplanted early in the
spring, setting them 2 feet apart. Height 10 to 12 inches.</p>

<p>The common wild Cranesbill (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>) improves
under cultivation, and is an attractive plant when it
stands in front of taller foliage.</p>

<p><b>Gilia.</b> Low-growing hardy annuals, good for
front borders or rockwork, growing from seed very quickly
and continuing in flower a long season. They will do well
in light soil. Sow seed in the fall or early spring where
plants are wanted. <i>Gilia tricolor</i>, blue, white and yellow,
is the best, but there are excellent white and red sorts.</p>

<p><b>Gladiolus.</b> A popular summer-flowering bulbous
plant, thriving best in moist, sandy loam, that has had
an application of well rotted manure the previous year.
No manure should be used the year of planting, as it has a
tendency to rot the bulbs. Plantings may be made from the
time the ground is in condition to work in the spring until
late in June. In planting, the bulbs should be set 3 inches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
deep and 8 to 10 inches apart, unless they are to be grown
in groups, when they may be planted five or six in the
space of 1 foot. Stakes should be furnished each plant
to support the flower-spike. When in groups, one stake
may be used, setting it in the middle of the circle.</p>

<p>Gladioli are increased by bulblets formed around the
old bulbs (or corms), or they may be grown from seed. The
bulblets should be planted in drills in April or May, and
will grow to flowering size in one or two years. In the
same way, seed sown early in drills, grown through the
summer, the little bulbs taken up and stored through the
winter and again planted out, will often make bulbs large
enough to flower the second year.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to lift all bulbs before freezing
weather, as most varieties are tender. They should be harvested
with the tops on, and laid away in a cool, dry place
to ripen. The tops are then cut off and the bulbs stored in
a dry place (fit for potatoes, but drier) until wanted the following
spring. <a href="#bulbs">See <i>Bulbs</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Glaucium</b>, or <span class="smcap">Horned Poppy</span>. The kind most
cultivated (<i>G. luteum</i>) has bright yellow flowers in July and
September. The flowers, contrasting with the deep cut
glaucous leaves, make a fine effect in the mixed or ribbon
border. Seed may be sown in the open ground where
wanted. Thin to 12 inches apart. Height 12 to 20 inches.
Perennial; but treated as a hardy annual.</p>

<p><b>Gloxinia.</b> Choice greenhouse tuberous-rooted
perennials, sometimes seen in window gardens, but really
not adapted to them. Gloxinias must have a uniform moist
and warm atmosphere and protection from the sun. They
will not stand abuse or varying conditions. Propagated
often by leaf-cuttings, which should give flowering plants
in one year. From the leaf, inserted half its length in the
soil (or sometimes only the petiole inserted) a tuber arises.
This tuber, after resting until midwinter or later, is planted
and flowering plants soon arise. Gloxinias also grow readily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
from seeds, which may be germinated in a temperature of
about 70°. Flowering plants may be had in a year if seeds
are sown in late winter or early spring. This is the
usual method. Soil should be porous and rich.</p>

<p><b>Godetia.</b> Very free-blooming annuals in fine
colors, harmonizing well with the California poppy. Many
of the varieties are beautifully blotched with contrasting
colors. They are very satisfactory plants for solid beds or
border lines, blooming from June to October. Seed may be
sown in heat, and seedlings planted in open ground at a distance
of 18 inches apart when danger of frost is over. A
rather poor soil will cause them to bloom better than one
very rich, as they are inclined to make a rank growth.
Height 1 to 2 feet.</p>

<p><b>Golden Feather.</b> <a href="#pyrethrum">See <i>Pyrethrum</i>.</a></p>

<p class="caption">Goldenrod</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="goldenrod" id="goldenrod"></a>Goldenrod</b> (<i>Solidago</i> of many species).
The Goldenrod of the wayside is so familiar that the
thought of bringing it into the garden is distasteful
to many persons. But if given a suitable place in a
well enriched border, no plant has greater possibilities.
A large clump against a hedge of green, or
massed behind a well grown plant of the blue-flowering
wild asters, makes a striking contrast. They bloom
late in the season, and the rich yellow and golden
colors and the graceful forms are always pleasing.</p>

<p>Goldenrods will grow more vigorously and the blooms be
larger if the roots are divided every third or fourth year.
There are several species catalogued by nurserymen, and
some of the stock is superior to the wild type, either having
a larger truss of flowers or blooming later. Goldenrods
range in height from 2 to 6 feet. All are easily propagated
by division. Transplant in the fall, if convenient, although
spring planting may be equally successful.</p>

may be sown in heat in March, the plants transplanted once
before setting out to cause them to grow stocky and branching;
or seed may be sown in a warm place where the plants
are to grow. The flowers, to retain their colors, should be
cut before fully expanded and dried in a dark, airy place.
<a href="#everlastings">See <i>Everlastings</i>.</a> Set the plants 18 inches apart. Height
12 inches. The heads resemble clover heads. The term
Bachelor’s Button is also given to the cornflower (<i>Centaurea
Cyanus</i>).</p>

<p><b>Gooseberry.</b> Since the advent of the practice
of spraying with fungicides to prevent mildew, the culture
of the Gooseberry has increased. There
is now no reason why, with a little care,
good crops of many of the best English varieties
may not be grown. The price for
good fruits of Gooseberry is usually remunerative,
as the market is rarely overstocked by the sudden
ripening of the crop, since the fruits ripen through a long
season. A large part of the crop is picked green for culinary
purposes. The leading market variety is Downing, a native
sort, which is little subject to mildew. Several of the English
varieties have proved of value, having larger fruits than
the natives. Whitesmith, Chautauqua, Triumph and Industry
are among the best.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 169px;">
<img src="images/114-gooseberries.jpg" width="169" height="71" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Gooseberries</p>
</div>

<p>The propagation of the Gooseberry is similar to that of
the currant, although the practice of earthing up a whole
plant, causing every branch thus covered to throw out roots,
is common with the European varieties. The rooted
branches are cut off the following spring and planted in
nursery rows or sometimes directly in the field. In order to
succeed with this method, the plant should have been cut
back to the ground so that all the shoots are yearling.</p>

<p>Pruning is essentially the same as for the currant
(<a href="#currant">which see</a>); and the treatment of the currant worm is the
same as for that fruit.</p>

<p>Gooseberries should be set (either in fall or spring) 3 to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
4 feet apart; rows 5 to 7 feet apart. Select a rich, rather
moist soil. The tops need no winter protection. If mildew
and worms are to be kept in check, spraying must
be begun with the very first sign of trouble and be thoroughly
done.</p>

<p><b><a name="gourds" id="gourds"></a>Gourds</b> are valuable as rapid-growing screen
vines, the curious fruits of many varieties adding much to
their attractiveness. Cultivation the same as for melons or
squashes. Height 10 to 15 feet. Provide a chicken-wire
trellis; or let them run on a brush pile.</p>

<p><b><a name="grafting" id="grafting"></a>Grafting.</b> Grafting is the operation of inserting
a piece of a plant into another plant with the intention
that it shall grow. It differs from the making of cuttings
in the fact that the severed part grows in another plant
rather than in the soil. There are two general kinds of
Grafting&mdash;one of which inserts a piece of branch in the
stock (Grafting proper), and one which inserts only a bud
with little or no wood attached (budding). In both cases
the success of the operation depends upon the growing
together of the cambium of the cion (or cutting) and that of
the stock. The cambium is the new and growing tissue
which lies underneath the bark and on the outside of the
growing wood. Therefore, the line of demarcation between
the bark and the wood should coincide when the cion and
stock are joined. The plant upon which the severed piece is
set is called the stock. The part which is removed and set
into the stock is called a cion if it is a piece of a branch, or
a bud if it is only a single bud with a bit of tissue attached.
The greater part of Grafting and budding is done when the
cion or bud is nearly or quite dormant. That is, Grafting
is usually done late in winter and early in spring, and budding
may be done then, or late in summer, when the buds
have nearly or quite matured.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 95px;">
<img src="images/116-grafting.jpg" width="87" height="172" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">The bud severed
from its twig</p>
</div>

<p>The prime object of Grafting is to perpetuate a kind of
plant which will not reproduce itself from seed or of which
seed is very difficult to obtain. Cions or buds are therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
taken from this plant and set into whatever kind of plant is
obtainable and on which they will grow. Thus, if one
wants to propagate the Baldwin apple, he does not for
that purpose sow seeds thereof, but takes cions or
buds from the tree and grafts them into some other
apple tree. The stocks are usually obtained from
seeds. In the case of the apple, young plants are
raised from seeds which are obtained mostly from
cider factories, without reference to the variety from
which they came. When the seedlings have grown
to a certain age, they are budded or grafted; and
thereafter they bear fruit like that of the tree from
which the cions were taken.</p>

<p class="caption">Whip-graft</p>
</div>

<p>There are many ways in which the union between cion
and stock is made. Budding may be first discussed.
It consists in inserting a bud underneath the bark of
the stock, and the commonest practice is that which is
shown in the illustrations. Budding is mostly performed
in July, August and early September, when
the bark is still loose or will peel. Twigs are cut
from the tree which it is desired to propagate, and
the buds are cut off with a sharp knife, a shield-shaped
bit of bark (with possibly a little wood) being left
with them (see illustration). The bud is then shoved into a
slit made in the stock, and it is held in place by tying
with some soft strand. In two or three weeks the bud
will have “stuck” (that is, it will have grown fast to
the stock), and the strand is cut to prevent its strangling
the stock. Ordinarily the bud does not grow until
the following spring, at which time the entire stock or
branch in which the bud is inserted is cut off an inch
above the bud; and the bud thereby receives all the
energy of the stock. Budding is the commonest Grafting
operation in nurseries. Seeds of peaches may be
sown in spring, and the plants which result will be ready
for budding that same August. The following spring, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a year from the planting of the seed, the stock is cut off
just above the bud (which is inserted near the ground), and
in the fall of that year the tree is ready for sale; that
is, the top is one season old and the root is two seasons
old, but in the trade it is known as a 1-year-old
tree. In apples and pears the stock is usually two
years old before it is budded, and the tree is not sold
until the top has grown two or three years. Budding
may be performed also in the spring, in which case the
bud will grow the same season. Budding is always
done in young branches, preferably in those not more
than one year old.</p>

<p>Grafting is the insertion of a small branch
(or cion), usually bearing more than one bud. If
Grafting is done on small stocks, it is customary
to employ the whip-graft, which is illustrated in the
margin. Both stock and cion are cut across diagonally,
and a split made in each, so that one fits into the
other. The graft is tied securely with a string, and
then, if it is above ground, it is also waxed carefully.
In larger limbs or stocks, the common method is to
employ the cleft-graft. This consists in cutting off the
stock, splitting it and inserting a wedge-shaped cion
in one or both sides of the split, taking care that
the cambium layer of the cion matches that of
the stock. The exposed surfaces are then securely
covered with wax. Grafting is usually performed
early in the spring, just before the buds swell. The
cions should have been cut before this time, when they
were perfectly dormant. Cions may be stored in sand
in the cellar or in the ice house, or they may be
buried in the field. The object is to keep them fresh
and dormant until they are wanted.</p>

<p class="caption">Cleft-grafting
a Cactus</p>
</div>

<p>If it is desired to change the top of an old plum,
apple or pear tree to some other variety, it is usually done
by means of the cleft-graft. If the tree is very young, budding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
or whip-grafting may be employed. On an old top the
cions should begin to bear when three to four years old.
All the main limbs should be grafted. It is important to
keep down the suckers or water-sprouts from around the
grafts, and part of the remaining top should be cut away
each year until the top is entirely changed over (which will
result in two to four years).</p>

<p>A good wax for covering the exposed parts is made as
follows: Resin, 4 parts by weight; beeswax, 2 parts; tallow,
1 part. In making the wax, the materials are first
broken up and melted together. When thoroughly melted
the liquid is poured into a pail or tub of cold water. It soon
becomes hard enough to handle, and it is then pulled and
worked over until it becomes tough or “gets a grain,” at
which stage it becomes the color of very light-colored
manilla paper. When wax is applied by hand, the hands
must be well greased. Hard cake tallow is the best material
for this purpose. In top-grafting large trees, it is
well to carry a supply of tallow when waxing, by smearing
the backs of the hands before entering the tree.</p>

<p><b>Grape.</b> One of the surest of fruit crops is
the Grape, a crop each year being reasonably certain after
the third year from the time of setting the vines. The
Grape does well on any soil that is under good cultivation
and well drained. A soil with considerable clay is better
under these circumstances than a light, sandy loam. The
exposure should be to the sun; and the place should admit
of cultivation on all sides. One- or 2-year-old vines should
be planted, either in the fall or early spring. At planting
the vine is cut back to 3 or 4 eyes, and the roots are well
shortened in. The hole in which the plant is to be set
should be large enough to allow a full spreading of the
roots. Fine soil should be worked around the roots and
firmed with the feet. If the season should be dry, a mulch
of coarse litter may be spread around the vine. If all the
buds start, the strongest one or two may be allowed to grow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
The canes arising from these buds should be staked and allowed
to grow through the season; or in large plantations the first-year
canes may be allowed to lie on the ground. The second
year one cane should be cut back to the same number of eyes
as the first year. After growth begins in the
spring, two of the strongest buds should be
allowed to remain. These two canes now arising
may be grown to a single stake through the
second summer, or they may be spread horizontally
on a trellis. These are the canes which
form the permanent arms or parts of the vine.
From them start the upright shoots which, in
succeeding years, are to bear the fruits.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 174px;">

<p class="caption">Grape</p>
</div>

<p>In order to understand the pruning of Grapes, the operator
must fully grasp this principle: <i>Fruit is borne on wood of
the present season, which arises from wood of the previous
season.</i> To illustrate: A growing shoot, or cane of 1899,
makes buds. In 1900 a shoot arises from each bud; and
near the base of this shoot the Grapes are borne (1 to 4
clusters on each). While every bud on the 1899 shoot may
produce shoots or canes in 1900, only the strongest of these
new canes will bear fruit. The skilled Grape-grower can
tell by the looks of his cane (as he prunes it in winter)
which buds will give rise to the Grape-producing wood the
following season. The larger and stronger buds usually
give best results; but if the cane itself is very big and
stout, or if it is very weak and slender, he does not expect
good results from any of its buds. A hard, well-ripened
cane the diameter of a man’s little finger is the ideal size.</p>

<p>Another principle to be mastered is this: <i>A vine should
bear only a limited number of clusters</i>,&mdash;say from 30 to 80. A
shoot bears clusters near its base; beyond these clusters the
shoot grows on into a long, leafy cane. An average of two
clusters may be reckoned to a shoot. If the vine is strong
enough to bear 60 clusters, 30 good buds must be left at the
pruning (which is done from December to late February).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
The essential operation of pruning a Grape vine, therefore,
is each year to cut back a limited number of good
canes to a few buds, and to cut off entirely all the remaining
canes or wood of the previous season’s growth. If a cane is
cut back to 2 or 3 buds, the stub-like part which remains is
called a spur. Present systems, however, cut each cane
back to 8 or 10 buds (on strong varieties), and 3 or 4 canes
are left,&mdash;all radiating from near the head or trunk of the
vine. The top of the vine does not grow bigger from year
to year, after it has once covered the trellis, but is cut back
to practically the same number of buds each year. Since
these buds are on new wood, it is evident that they are each
year farther and farther removed from the head of the vine.
In order to obviate this difficulty, new canes are taken out
each year or two from near the head of the vine, and the
2-year or 3-year-old wood is cut away.</p>

<p>The training of Grapes is a different matter. A dozen
different systems of training may be practiced on the same
trellis and from the same style of pruning,&mdash;for training is
only the disposition or arrangement of the parts.</p>

<p>On arbors, it is best to carry one permanent arm or
trunk from each root over the framework to the peak. Each
year the canes are cut back to short spurs (of 2 or 3 buds)
along the sides of this trunk.</p>

<p>Grapes are set from 6 to 8 feet apart in rows which are
8 to 10 feet apart. A trellis made of 2 or 3 wires is the
best support. Slat trellises catch too much wind and blow
down. Avoid stimulating manures. In very cold climates,
the vines may be taken off the trellis in early winter and
laid on the ground and lightly covered with earth. Along
the boundaries of home lots, where Grapes are often planted,
little is to be expected in the way of fruit because the ground
is not well tilled. For mildew and rot, spray with Bordeaux
mixture. <a href="#spraying">See <i>Spraying</i>.</a></p>

<p>Concord is the most cosmopolitan variety, but its quality
is not the best. For the home garden, a good selection may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
be made from the following list: Winchell or Green Mountain,
Campbell Early, Worden, Concord, Niagara, Moore
Diamond, Vergennes, Agawam, Salem, Wilder, Iona,
Brighton, Delaware.</p>

<p><b>Grapery.</b> The European grapes rarely thrive
out of doors in eastern America. Grape houses are necessary,
with or without artificial heat. Fruit for home use may
be grown very satisfactorily in a cold Grapery (without artificial
heat). A simple lean-to against the south side of a
building or wall is cheap and serviceable. When a separate
building is desired, an even-span house running north and
south is preferable. There is no advantage in having a
curved roof, except as a matter of looks. A compost of four
parts rotted turf to one of manure is laid on a sloping cement
bottom outside the house, making a border 12 feet wide and
2 feet deep. The cement may be replaced with rubble on
well drained soils, but it is a poor makeshift. Every three
years the upper 6 inches of the border should be renewed
with manure. The border inside the house is prepared likewise.
Two-year-old potted vines are planted about 4 feet
apart in a single row. Part of the roots go through a crevice
in the wall to the outer border and part remain inside; or all
may go outside if the house is desired for other purposes.
One strong cane is trained to a wire trellis hanging at least
18 inches from the glass, and is cut back to 3 feet the first
year, 6 the second, and 9 the third. Do not be in a hurry
to get a long cane. Pruning is on the spur system, as recommended
for arbors on <a href="#Page_120">page 120</a>. The vines are usually laid
on the ground for winter and covered with leaves or wrapped
with cloth.</p>

<p>As soon as the buds swell in early spring, tie the vines
to the trellis and start out one shoot from each spur, rubbing
off all others. After the berries begin to color, however,
it is better to leave all further growth to shade the fruit.
Pinch back each of these laterals two joints beyond the
second bunch. To keep down red spider and thrips, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
foliage should be sprayed with water every bright morning
except during the blooming season. At least one-third of
the berries should be thinned from each bunch; do not be
afraid of taking out too many. Water the inside border
frequently all through the summer, and the outside occasionally
if the season is dry. Mildew may appear in July.
The best preventives are to syringe faithfully, admit air
freely, and sprinkle sulfur on the ground.</p>

<p>Fruit may be kept fresh on the vines in a warm (or artificially
heated) Grapery until late December: in a coldhouse
it must be picked before frost. After the fruit is off, ventilate
from top and bottom and withhold water, so as to thoroughly
ripen the wood. Along in November the canes are
pruned, covered with straw or wrapped with mats and laid
down till spring. Black Hamburg is superior to all other
varieties for a cold Grapery; Bowood Muscat, Muscat of
Alexandria and Chasselas Musque may be added in the warmhouse.
Good vines will live and bear almost indefinitely.&mdash;<i>S. W. Fletcher.</i></p>

<p><b><a name="grass" id="grass"></a>Grasses</b> of various kinds are grown for ornament,
the most popular types being the hardy perennials,
which make attractive clumps in the lawn or border. The
best of the permanent kinds in the North are the various
sorts of Eulalia (properly Miscanthus). When once established
they remain for years, making large and bold clumps.
The striped kind, or zebra grass, is particularly good. These
grasses thrive in any good soil. They grow from 4 to 7 feet
high. The great reed, or <i>Arundo Donax</i>, is a bold subject
and perfectly hardy. In a rich and rather moist soil, it
grows 10 to 12 feet high when well established. Pampas
Grass is most excellent in the Middle States and South.
Some of the big native grasses and sedges make attractive
lawn clumps.</p>

<p>Grasses are also grown for dry or everlasting bouquets.
For this purpose, small-growing delicate annual species are
mostly used. Good types are species of agrostis, briza,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
bromus, eragrostis, and pennisetum. Seeds of these and
of others are sold by seedsmen. With ordinary treatment,
they thrive in any garden soil.</p>

<p><b>Greenhouse.</b> In America the word Greenhouse
has come to be applied to all kinds of glass-houses in which
plants are grown. Originally the word was applied to those
houses in which plants are merely preserved or kept green
during the winter. Other types of glass-houses are the conservatory,
in which plants are displayed; stove or hothouse,
in which plants are grown in a high temperature; the propagating
pit, in which the multiplication of plants is carried
forward; and the houses which have various temperatures,
as cold, cool and intermediate. The principles which underlie
the construction and management of glass-houses are too
extensive to be discussed here. The reader should refer to
special books on the topic. For the general subject, Taft’s
“Greenhouse Construction” and “Greenhouse Management”
are excellent. For particular applications to floriculture,
Hunt’s “How to Grow Cut-flowers” is a standard work.
For applications to the forcing of vegetable crops, Bailey’s
“Forcing-Book” may perhaps be consulted.</p>

<p>The smaller the glass-house the more difficult it is to
manage, because it is likely to be more variable in temperature,
moisture and other conditions. This is particularly
true if the house is a small lean-to against the south side of
a dwelling house, for it becomes very hot at midday and
comparatively cold at night. In order to moderate the heat
in these little houses, it is ordinarily advisable to use ground
glass for the roof or to whitewash it. The house conservatory
may be heated by a coal stove, but the best results are
rarely to be attained in this case. A stove is likely to leak
gas, and the temperature is more or less uneven. The best
results are to be attained when the conservatory is heated
by steam or hot water, piped in the modern fashion with
wrought iron pipes, which go together with threads. If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
conservatory is heated from the heater which supplies the
dwelling house, it should have an extra amount of pipe;
otherwise it will be necessary to keep the dwelling house
too hot for comfort in order to maintain the conservatory at
its proper temperature. It is always best, when practicable,
to heat the conservatory with a separate apparatus. There
are various small hot water and steam heaters, the size of coal
stoves, which are excellent for the purpose. For a small
conservatory, hot water is usually preferable to steam, since
it is less likely to fluctuate. For large establishments, however,
the steam is usually the better. For further discussions
of related subjects, see <a href="#hotbed"><i>Hotbed</i></a>, <a href="#window-gardens"><i>Window Garden</i></a>,

<p><b>Grevillea.</b> A very graceful greenhouse plant,
suitable for house culture. The plants grow freely from
seed, and until they become too large are as decorative as
ferns. Grevilleas are really trees, and are valuable in
greenhouses and rooms only in their young state. They
withstand much abuse. They are now very popular as jardiniere
subjects. Seeds sown in spring will give handsome
plants by the next winter.</p>

<p><b>Gypsophila.</b> <span class="smcap">Baby’s Breath.</span> <i>Gypsophila
muralis</i> is one of the dainty little plants called Baby’s Breath.
It is a low-growing annual forming compact mounds of green,
thickly covered with little pink flowers. It is one of the
most attractive border plants in cultivation. It is also a
charming pot-plant. <i>G. paniculata</i> is a hardy perennial having
panicles of bluish white flowers. This is very graceful, and
the flowers are fine for cutting and for use with sweet pea
bouquets or with other choice flowers. The panicles are so
lasting that they may be used in winter bouquets. The annuals
may be planted 1 foot apart; the perennials 3 feet.
Both are readily grown from seed, and bloom the first year.</p>

<p><a name="H" id="H"></a><b>Hardy.</b> A relative term, used to denote a
plant which endures the climate (particularly the winter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
climate) of a given place. Half-hardy plants are those
which withstand some frost or uncongenial conditions, but
will not endure the severity of the climate. Tender plants
are those which are injured by light frosts.</p>

<p><b>Hedges.</b> Hedges are much less used in this
country than in Europe, and for several reasons. Our
climate is dry, and most Hedges do not thrive so well here as
there; labor is high-priced, and the trimming is therefore
likely to be neglected; our farms are so large that much
fencing is required; timber and wire are cheaper than live
Hedges. However, they are used with good effects about
the home grounds. In order to secure a good Hedge, it is
necessary to have a thoroughly well-prepared, deep soil, to
set the plants close, and to shear them at least twice every
year. For evergreen Hedges the most serviceable plant in
general is the arborvitæ. The plants may be set at distances
of 1 to 2½ feet apart. For choice Hedges about the
grounds, particularly outside the northern states, some of
the retinosporas are very useful. One of the most satisfactory
of all coniferous plants for Hedges is the common
hemlock, which stands shearing well and makes a very soft
and pleasing mass. The plants may be set from 1 to 3 feet
apart. Other plants which hold their leaves and are good
for Hedges are the common box and the privets. Box
Hedges are the best for very low borders about walks and
flower beds. The dwarf variety can be kept down to a
height of 6 inches to a foot for any number of years. The
larger-growing varieties make excellent Hedges 3, 4 and 5
feet high. The ordinary privet or prim holds its leaves well
into winter in the North. The so-called Californian privet
holds its leaves rather longer and stands better along the
seashore. In the southern states, nothing is better than
<i>Citrus trifoliata</i>.</p>

<p>For Hedges of deciduous plants, the most common species
are the buckthorn, the European thorn apple or cratægus,
osage orange, and various kinds of roses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Hedges should be trimmed the year after they are set,
although they should not be trimmed very closely until they
reach the desired or permanent height. Thereafter they
should be sheared into the desired form in spring or fall.
If the plants are allowed to grow for a year or two without
trimming, they lose their lower leaves and become open and
straggly. Osage orange and some other plants are plashed&mdash;that
is, the plants are set at an angle rather than perpendicularly,
and they are wired together in such a way that
they make an impenetrable barrier just above the surface of
the ground.</p>

<p><b>Helianthus.</b> <a href="#sunflower">See <i>Sunflower</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Helichrysum.</b> These are perhaps the most
popular of the Everlastings (<a href="#everlastings">which see</a>), having large flowers
of several colors. They grow readily from seed, blooming
from July to October. Height 10 inches to 2 feet. Should
be planted or thinned to stand 18 inches apart.</p>

<p><b>Heliotrope.</b> A universal favorite house or
border plant, growing readily from cuttings or seeds, and
producing quantities of fragrant violet, purple or white
flowers. One of the best methods of cultivation is to set a
strong plant in the border and peg the new growths to the
ground, where they will root and form a perfect mat, flowering
profusely during the fall months until frost. They
will endure the temperature of a living room well if the
room is not too dry. Red spider is a natural enemy of the
Heliotrope, and when once it obtains a foothold is a very
difficult pest to manage, but frequent syringing with water
will keep it in check. A light, rich soil and an abundance
of heat are their requirements. Height 1 to 3 feet. Propagated
by cuttings or layers.</p>

<p><b><a name="hellebore" id="hellebore"></a>Hellebore</b> (White Hellebore) is often used for
the killing of currant-worms and other insects (<a href="#currant">see <i>Currant</i></a>).
It is not so poisonous as the arsenites, and therefore is to be
preferred when it is necessary to apply a poison to nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
ripe fruit. It is usually applied in a spray with water, at
the rate of ⅓ ounce to the gallon. It is harmless to foliage.</p>

<p><b>Helleborus</b>, or <span class="smcap">Christmas Rose</span>, may be had
in flower at the holidays if grown in a frame and protected.
The usual time for it to flower in the open border is
in March or early April. It will continue to bloom for many
years if grown in a shady place. Roots may be divided as
an increase is wanted. It may also be grown from seeds;
and seedlings may be expected to bloom a year from the
spring in which they are sown. Height 6 to 10 inches.</p>

<p><b>Hemerocallis</b>, or <span class="smcap">Yellow Day Lily</span>. <a href="#funkia">The
advice given under Funkia will apply to this.</a></p>

<p><b><a name="herbs" id="herbs"></a>Herbs</b> are plants which die to the ground in
winter. They may be annual, biennial, or perennial. For
a list of annual Herbs suitable for the flower garden, see
the articles on <a href="#annuals"><i>Annuals</i></a> and <a href="#bedding"><i>Bedding</i></a>. A border or free mass
of perennial Herbs is one of the charms of any place. It is
informal, easy of care, and self-sustaining. The large part
of the mass should be composed of common and hardy
things&mdash;wild or from gardens&mdash;and incidental features
may be made of the choicer and rarer exotics. In most
cases, plants look better when judiciously mixed than when
planted one kind in a bed. <a href="#border">See <i>Border</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Hibiscus.</b> Annuals and perennials, some of
them shrubs, with showy, hollyhock-like flowers. The annual
Hibiscuses are very satisfactory. They grow quickly
and flower freely. The flowers are usually white or yellow,
of large size, and appear from July on. The herbaceous
perennial kinds are amongst the best of hardy border
plants, blooming in late summer and fall. The commonest
of these is <i>Hibiscus Moscheutos</i>. Give rich, moist soil.</p>

<p>The greenhouse species are old favorites. They may be
used in outdoor bedding through the summer, lifted in the
fall and cut back. Keep rather dry and dormant during
winter. Propagated by cuttings.</p>

<p><b>Hoes</b> should be of several patterns if the
most efficient work is to be done in the garden. The
ordinary Hoe is adapted only to the rougher and coarser
Hoe-work, such as digging and fitting the ground. For
much of the subsequent tillage, some of the narrow-blade
and pointed Hoes are excellent. For cutting
off weeds, the push Hoe or scarifier is excellent.</p>

<p class="caption">Hollyhocks</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="hollyhock" id="hollyhock"></a>Hollyhock.</b> These old garden favorites
have been neglected of late years, primarily
because the Hollyhock rust has been so prevalent,
destroying the plants or making the unsightly.
The double varieties seem to suffer the
most; and for that reason, and from the fact that
the less formal type is in favor, the single varieties are now
the most generally grown. Their culture is very simple. The
seed is usually sown in July or August, and the plants set
where wanted the following spring. They will bloom the
same year in which they are transplanted&mdash;the year following
the seed-sowing. New plants should be set every two
years, as the old crowns are apt to rot or die after the first
flowering. For rust, spray early with Bordeaux
mixture or ammoniacal carbonate of copper.</p>

<p><b><a name="hop" id="hop"></a>Hop, Ornamental.</b> <i>Humulus Japonicus</i>,
or the annual <span class="smcap">Hop</span>, is one of the best
rapid-growing screen vines in cultivation. It
makes a dense canopy of attractive foliage. The
leaves are finely cut, and in one variety variegated
with white. This variegated variety is a
fine vine for a porch or front screen, always
attracting attention to its markings. This Hop
is propagated by seed sown in boxes in March.
When once established, it will seed itself and
start as soon as the soil becomes warm. Set
plants 4 to 8 feet apart. Height 8 to 20 feet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<b>Horseradish.</b> As a kitchen garden vegetable,
this is usually planted in some out-of-the-way spot and a
piece of the root dug as often as needed, the fragments of
roots being left in the soil to grow for further use. This
method results in having nothing but tough, stringy roots,
very unlike the product of a properly planted and well
cared for bed. The best roots are those planted in the
spring at the time of setting early cabbage, and dug as late
the same fall as the weather will permit. It becomes,
therefore, an annual crop. The roots for planting are
small pieces, from 4 to 6 inches long, obtained when trimming
the roots dug in the fall. These pieces may be packed
in sand and stored until wanted the following spring. In
planting, the roots should be set with the upper end 3 inches
below the surface of the ground, using a dibber or sharp-pointed
stick in making the holes. The crop may be planted
between rows of early-sown beets, lettuce or other crop,
and given full possession of the ground when these crops are
harvested. Where the ground is inclined to be stiff or the
subsoil is near the surface, the roots may be set in a slanting
position. In fact, many gardeners practice this method
of planting, thinking that the roots make a better growth
and are more uniform in size.</p>

<p><b><a name="hotbed" id="hotbed"></a>Hotbed.</b> A Hotbed is a frame or box which
has artificial heat and a transparent covering and in which
plants are grown. It differs from a coldframe (<a href="#coldframe">which see</a>)
in the fact that it has artificial bottom heat. This bottom
heat is usually supplied by fermenting organic matter,
chiefly horse manure, but hot air, hot water or steam conveyed
in pipes, may be employed. It is covered with sash
of which the normal or standard size is 3 feet wide and 6
feet long. These sashes are laid crosswise the box or frame.
The standard size of frame is 6 feet wide and 12 feet long.
A “frame,” therefore, accommodates four sashes. However,
the frame may be of any length desired. This frame is
ordinarily made of boards, and the back of it is 3 or 4<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
inches higher than the front, so that the sashes slope to
the sun. It is customary to have a space of 6 to 10 inches
between the earth and the sash on the lower or front side.
The manure which is used to heat the bed
may be placed on top of the ground and the
frame set on the pile, or it may be placed
in a pit. If the land is warm and well drained,
it is ordinarily better to have a pit from 1 to
2 feet deep and to set the frame over it. This
is especially the case if it is desired to have a permanent
Hotbed yard. The place in which the frames are set should
be protected from the cold and prevailing winds by a rising
slope, a high board fence, a building, hedge, or other obstruction.
If the frame yard is near the main buildings,
it will be much more accessible in rainy or snowy times,
and the plants are likely to have better care. Water should
also be handy.</p>

<p class="caption">Section of a Hotbed</p>
</div>

<p>The time of starting a Hotbed will depend upon the
kinds of plants to be grown, the amount of time which one
wishes to gain, and something, also, on the quality of the
manure. The hardier the plant the earlier it can be started.
In the latitude of New York, from the first to the middle of
March is the usual time for starting a Hotbed. In this bed are
sown seeds of early flowers and such vegetables as cabbage,
cauliflower, tomato, etc. In the raising of any plants in the
Hotbed, it is very essential that they do not become “drawn”
or “leggy.” In order to prevent this, they must be given
plenty of room, thorough ventilation on all pleasant days,
and not too great heat. It is well to transplant them once
or twice before they are finally set in the field, especially if
they are started, in New York, as early as the first or middle
of March. When they are transplanted, they can be set in
another Hotbed or in a coldframe; but it is important that
the succeeding frames in which they are set should not be
very much colder than the one in which they grew, else they
may become stunted. It is well, however, to transplant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
them into a gradually cooler and freer atmosphere in order
to harden them off, so that they may go into the open ground
without danger. On every pleasant day, raise the sash at
the upper end 1 or 2 inches, or if the sun shines brightly
and the wind does not blow, give even more air; and eventually
strip off the sashes entirely. It is very important that
the plants are not kept too close and grown too soft. It is
usually advisable to sow cabbage, lettuce and other hardy
plants in different frames from tomatoes and other tender
things, in order that the proper requirements may be given
to each. At night the Hotbeds (at least early in the season)
will need more protection than the glass sash. It was formerly
the custom to use thick rye-straw mats to cover Hotbeds,
but it is now a common practice to use the straw
matting which can be bought of carpet dealers. This
is rolled out on the sashes at night in one or two thicknesses;
and if the weather is sharp, board shutters, the
size of the sash, may be laid on top. As the manure heat
begins to fail give more and more air, so that the plants
may be able to shift for themselves when the bottom heat is
finally exhausted.</p>

<p>Fresh horse manure is the material which is commonly
used for the heating of Hotbeds. If it can be secured from
livery stables, so that it is all of nearly or quite the same age,
better results may be expected. Manure from highly fed
horses usually heats better than that from horses which receive
little grain, or in which there is very much litter. Put
the manure in a pile, preferably under cover, and as soon as
it shows signs of heating, fork it over in order to mix the
entire mass and to cause it to heat evenly. When it is
steaming throughout the whole mass, it may be put in the
bed. Assuming that the Hotbed has a pit beneath it, it is
well to put in 2 or 3 inches of coarse litter in order to keep
the manure off the cold ground. The manure is then put in
and tramped down, in layers of 4 to 6 inches each. If the
manure is of the right consistency, it will pack without becoming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
dense and soggy; that is, it will spring a little beneath
the feet. If it has too much litter, it will fluff up
under the feet and not pack well. From 18 to 24 or even 30
inches of manure is placed in the pit. On top, an inch of
dry straw or light leaf-mold may be placed to serve as a distributor
of the heat to the earth above. From 3 to 4 inches
of rich, light earth is placed upon this, in which to sow the
seed. The manure will ordinarily heat violently for a few
days. Place a soil thermometer in it, and as soon as the
temperature begins to fall below 90° the seeds of tomatoes
and egg-plants may be sown; and when it begins to fall below
80°, the seeds of cabbages, lettuce and cauliflower may
be sown. If the frame is not placed over a pit and the
manure is put on top of the ground, it will be necessary to
allow the body of manure to project 1 or 2 feet in all directions
in order to prevent the edges of the bed from freezing.</p>

<p>In starting plants in a Hotbed, one must not expect to
gain as much time in the crop as he gains in the starting of
the seeds: that is, if he starts the seeds two months ahead
of the normal season, he will not gain two months in the
ripening of the crop. Ordinarily, he cannot expect to gain
much more than one-half the time, particularly if the plants
are transplanted to the field from the Hotbed.</p>

<p>Some plants may be grown to maturity in the Hotbed,
particularly lettuce and radishes. After Hotbeds
have been emptied of their plants, the sashes may be
stored away, and the frames, with their spent manure,
used for the growing of an early summer crop of melons
or cucumbers.</p>

</div>

<p><b><a name="hyacinth_bean" id="hyacinth_bean"></a>Hyacinth Bean</b> (<i>Dolichos Lablab</i>). A very
rapid-growing twiner, bearing fragrant flowers of purple
or white. It is a fine screen plant. Plant seeds when the
ground is warm where the plants are to grow; or they may
be started early in pots. Height 10 feet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<b><a name="hyacinths" id="hyacinths"></a>Hyacinths</b> are most popular winter- or spring-flowering
bulbs. Hyacinths are hardy, but they are often
used as window or greenhouse plants. They are easy to
grow and very satisfactory. For winter flowering the bulbs
should be procured early in the fall, potted in October in soil
composed of loam, leaf-mold and sand. If ordinary flower
pots are used, put in the bottom a few pieces of broken pots,
charcoal or small stones for drainage; then fill the pot with
dirt, so that when the bulb is planted the top will be on a
level with the rim of the pot. Fill in around the bulb with
soil, leaving just the tip of the bulb showing. These pots of
bulbs should be placed in a cold pit, cellar or on the shady
side of a building. In all cases, plunge the pot in some cool material
(as cinders). Before the weather becomes cold enough
to freeze a crust on the ground, the pots should have a protection
of straw or leaves to keep the bulbs from severe freezing.
In from six to eight weeks the bulbs should have made
roots enough to grow the plant, and the pots may be
placed in a cool room for a short time. When the plants have
started into growth, they may be placed in a warmer situation.
Watering should be carefully attended to from this
time, and when the plant is in bloom the pot may be set in a
saucer or other shallow dish containing water. After flowering,
the bulbs may be ripened by gradually withholding water
until the leaves die. They may then be planted out in the
border, where they will bloom each spring for a number of
years, but will never prove satisfactory for forcing again.
The open ground culture of Hyacinths is the same as for
tulips, <a href="#tulips">which see</a>. <a href="#bulbs">See <i>Bulbs</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Water Culture of Hyacinths.</i>&mdash;The Hyacinth is the most
popular of the Dutch bulbs for growing in vases. The Narcissus
may be grown in water, and do just as well, but it is
not as pretty in glasses as the Hyacinth. Glasses for Hyacinths
may be had of florists who deal in supplies, and in
various shapes and colors. The usual form is tall and narrow,
with a cup-like mouth to receive the bulb. They are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
filled with water, so that it will just reach the base of the
bulb when it has been placed in position in the cup above.
The vessels of dark-colored glass are preferable to those of
clear glass, as roots prefer darkness. When the glasses, or
bowls as above mentioned, have been arranged, they are set
away in a cool, dark place to form roots like potted bulbs.
Results are usually secured earlier in water than in soil. To
keep the water sweet, a few lumps of charcoal may be put
in the glass. As the water evaporates, add fresh; add
enough so that it runs over, and thereby renews that in the
glass. Do not disturb the roots by taking out the bulb.</p>

<p><b>Hydrangea.</b> One of the commonest lawn
shrubs is <i>Hydrangea paniculata</i>. The commonest fault in
growing it is scattering the plants over the lawn, where
they suffer in the competition with grass roots, and do not
show off to advantage. It is far better to mass them in
front of taller things. The Hydrangea blooms on wood of
the season; therefore it should be pruned after bloom&mdash;in
winter or early spring (<a href="#pruning">see <i>Pruning</i></a>). Cut back heavily, in
order to secure the strong new shoots upon which the
flowers are borne.</p>

<p><b>Hyssop.</b> <a href="#sweet_herbs">See <i>Sweet Herbs</i>.</a></p>

<p><a name="I" id="I"></a><b>Ice Plant</b>, or <span class="smcap">Mesembryanthemum</span>. Fine little
plants for rockwork or edging. The majority of the species
are greenhouse and window plants, but a few can be
recommended for outdoor planting. A very sunny location,
with gravelly soil, will give the best results, either in the
open or in the house. Easily propagated by pieces of the
plant laid on moist sand in a somewhat sunny place. The
common Ice Plant of window-gardens is readily grown from
seeds or slips. It is prized for its glandular-glistening thick
foliage (whence the common name). The little flowers,
which open in sunshine, are also interesting.</p>

18 inches.</p>

<p><b><a name="insects" id="insects"></a>Insects.</b> For horticultural purposes, Insects
might be grouped into three general classes: borers, or those
which live inside the plant tissue; chewing
Insects which live on the outside of
the plant; and the sucking Insects.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 206px;">
<img src="images/135-moth.jpg" width="206" height="149" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Moth of one of the borers</p>
</div>

<p>As a general statement, it may be
said that the digging out of borers is the
only complete remedy. Sometimes an
application of something to the body of
the tree may keep them out, but it is always
uncertain; and it usually involves more work than to
dig them out. All trees which are subject to borers (especially
apples, peaches and pears) should be examined at
least twice every year. <a href="#borers">See <i>Borers</i>.</a></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 195px;">
<img src="images/135-beetle.jpg" width="195" height="165" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A beetle borer</p>
</div>

<p>The general run of chewing or biting Insects may be
killed by the arsenical poisons. Such Insects are the common
types of worms and beetles which feed on foliage. The
leading poison which is now used for this purpose is Paris
green (<a href="#paris_green">which see</a>). Hellebore and pyrethrum are useful
when it is not advisable to use arsenical
poisons.</p>

<p>The sucking Insects include all the kinds
of plant lice, the squash bug and all the
scale Insects. These are dispatched by
some material which kills by external application,
especially material which has kerosene
or petroleum in it. The common material
heretofore used for this purpose is
kerosene and soap emulsion; but it is now believed that the
emulsion of kerosene and water is fully as efficient, and since
machines have been perfected for automatically mixing it, it
is a much more practicable remedy. <a href="#kerosene_emulsion">See <i>Kerosene Emulsion</i>.</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the fighting of all Insects, success depends upon taking
them in time. If something is known of the life history
of the Insect, very much will be gained, for the operator
may be on hand as soon as the Insect is
expected to appear.</p>

<p><i>Insects on House Plants.</i>&mdash;The most troublesome
or common Insects with which the amateur
is likely to meet in the window-garden or conservatory
are the red spider, mite, mealy bug, aphis, and scale.</p>

<p>The red spider is a very minute Insect with a reddish
body. Its presence may be suspected whenever plants are
growing in a warm and dry place. Usually it first appears
on the under side of leaves, but it multiplies rapidly, and
will soon not be so choice of position. It sucks the juices of
the leaves, and they soon indicate the injury by a dull appearance,
and also, in many cases, by small whitish or paler
areas on the upper surfaces. The mite is of similar habits
and size, but is of a pale color, with black on its back.
It appears under the same conditions as the red spider.
These pests are small, but are very serious if allowed
to multiply unchecked. They should be looked after as
soon as their presence is detected.</p>

<p>The remedy is to arrange for keeping the air about the
plants more moist, and giving drenchings of the foliage
with clear or soapy water. The latter is most effective.
The soap used may be simply the common washing soap, or
that sold at drug stores known as whale-oil soap. In fighting
them, care must be used not to keep the soil soaked
with water, or it will check the plants in vigor and only add
to the strength of the enemy. Even florists sometimes get
into just such a predicament. Flagging and extreme variations
in dryness and humidity of the air, checking the vigor
of plants, favor the appearance and presence of the red
spider quite as much as extreme and continued dryness of
the air.</p>

<p>The aphids or plant lice are readily discernable when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
they appear on plants, as they are sure to do under nearly all
conditions. They are small, have elongated, succulent bodies,
move about slowly and awkwardly, on rather long, hairlike
legs, and are most commonly of a pale green color, though
often brown or reddish, and sometimes of other shades.
Fumigation of the plants in a closed box with burning
tobacco stems will kill them. Latterly florists evaporate a
liquid extract of tobacco (which is sold by dealers in
florists’ supplies) by dropping a hot iron into a pan of it. A
tea made by soaking tobacco stems in water for a few hours,
and applied with a syringe, is effective, and a safe remedy
in inexperienced hands. A tablespoonful of tobacco
sheep-dip, or extract of tobacco, to a couple of gallons of
water, also makes an effective syringing or dipping solution.
As mentioned above, we should use care, especially in the
winter time, when the soil often dries out slowly, to avoid
soaking it when already wet or sufficiently moist.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 135px;">
<img src="images/137-suck.jpg" width="135" height="258" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">One of the kind
which sucks its food</p>
</div>

<p>Mealy bug has a small, flat, tortoise-shaped body,
from about one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch long.
The Insects collect in masses in the axils of the
leaves. They are covered with a white mealy or
cottony substance, and are readily recognized,
although persons unfamiliar with their appearance
have sometimes mistaken them for bits of down
or cotton lodged upon the foliage or in the axils
of the leaves. The young are small, and likely
to escape observation unless one looks closely.
They are flat, of a creamy or pinkish tint, and lie
close to the surface of the leaves, especially on the
under surface. Coleus and bouvardias are among
the plants upon which mealy bugs are most often
found. Owing to the oily nature of their covering,
it is difficult to wet their bodies with any ordinary liquid that
may be applied for the purpose of destroying them. Fir-tree
oil is one of the most effective remedies for them. This liquid
is rather expensive, but for a small collection a gallon can will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
last for a long time. It is also effective against other Insects.
For mealy bugs, two tablespoonfuls of the oil to one
pint of water will make an effective dipping or spraying solution.
Soft or rain-water should be used, and tin, wooden,
or earthenware vessels. Galvanized iron vessels are to be
avoided. Apply forcibly with a syringe or atomizer, preferably
in the evening. If effective, the mealy bug
will turn buff-color. For other Insects, except for
the scale, mentioned below, the solution will not
need to be more than half or a fourth so strong.
Where there are only a few mealy bugs, the plant
may be gone over with a soft brush and the Insects
crushed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/138-codmoth.jpg" width="120" height="77" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">The codlin-moth</p>
</div>

<p>Scales are most commonly of a brown or whitish
color, flat or tortoise-shaped, and easily seen. They adhere
closely by the under surface of their bodies to the stems,
branches, and foliage of woody plants. The mature Insect
is stationary, and its body at length becomes a shell containing
hundreds of eggs. These hatch, and the young emerge
from the shell, crawl about and settle, to develop into the familiar
form. A strong solution of fir-tree oil, like that used for
mealy bugs, is a good remedy. A strong solution of whale-oil
soap, made by adding an ounce or more of the soap to three
gallons of water, even more if necessary, is also useful in
combating them. After dipping or syringing the plants
they may be allowed to stand over night, when they should
be rinsed off with clear water. Applications may need repeating
every three or four days until the Insects are gotten
rid of. It is difficult, for a time, to tell when they are dead.
If killed, the bodies will fall off easily, and in the case of the
soft-shelled species shrivel up somewhat after a time.
Kerosene and water emulsion (<a href="#kerosene">see <i>Kerosene</i></a>) will kill them.</p>

<p><b>Insecticide.</b> A substance which will kill insects.
Insecticides are of two general classes&mdash;those that kill by
contact (<a href="#kerosene">see <i>Kerosene</i></a>), and those that poison the insect (see
<a href="#paris_green"><i>Paris Green</i></a> and <a href="#hellebore"><i>Hellebore</i></a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<b>Iris.</b> Many handsome perennials, of which the
Blue Flag is familiar to every old-fashioned garden. Most
Irises thrive best in a rather moist soil, and some of them
may be colonized in the water in margins of ponds. Gardeners
usually divide them into two sections&mdash;the tuberous-rooted
or rhizomatous, and the bulbous. A third division&mdash;the
fibrous-rooted&mdash;is sometimes made. The common and
most serviceable species belong to the tuberous-rooted section.
Here belongs the beautiful and varied Japanese
Iris, <i>Iris lævigata</i> (or <i>I. Kæmpferi</i>), which is among the
most deserving of all hardy perennials. Most of these Irises
need no special care. They are propagated by division of
the rootstocks. Plant the pieces 1 foot apart if a mass
effect is desired. When the plants begin to fail, dig them
up, divide the roots, discard the old parts and grow a new
stock, as before. <i>I. Susiana</i>, of this section, is one of the
oddest of Irises, but it is not quite hardy in the North. Of
the bulbous section, most species are not hardy in the
North. The bulbs should be taken up and replanted every
two or three years. The Persian and Spanish Irises belong
here. The bulbs give rise to but a single stem.</p>

<p><a name="K" id="K"></a><b><a name="kale" id="kale"></a>Kale.</b> A low-growing, spreading plant belonging
to the cabbage family and extensively used for
winter and spring greens. The same culture as given to late
cabbage is suitable. At the approach of severe freezing
weather a slight protection is given in the North. The
leaves remain green through the winter and may be gathered
from under the snow at a time when material for greens is
scarce. Some of the Kales are very ornamental because of
their blue and purple curled foliage. The Scotch Curled is
the most popular variety. Kales are extensively grown at
Norfolk, Va., and southward, and shipped north in winter.
Let the plants stand 18 to 30 inches apart. Young cabbage
plants are sometimes used as Kale. <a href="#collards">See <i>Collards</i>.</a> Borecole
is a kind of Kale. Sea Kale is a wholly different vegetable
(<a href="#sea-kale">which see</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
<b><a name="kerosene" id="kerosene"></a>Kerosene</b> is fatal to insects. It is likely to
injure plants if applied full strength, although if applied in
full sunlight (so that evaporation takes place rapidly) it may
do no harm. It is safest to apply it in dilution. Of late,
there are pumps which mix or emulsify Kerosene and water
in definite proportions, and this mixture (in the proportion
of ⅕ or ¼ Kerosene) is fatal to insects and usually harmless to
plants. The standard Kerosene emulsion is with soap, but
the perfection of mechanical devices for emulsifying it with
water is probably destined to supplant the soap emulsion.</p>

<p><i><a name="kerosene_emulsion" id="kerosene_emulsion"></a>Kerosene Emulsion.</i>&mdash;Hard soap, ½ pound; boiling soft
water, 1 gallon; Kerosene, 2 gallons. Dissolve the soap in the
water, add the Kerosene, and churn with a pump for 5 to 10
minutes. Dilute 10 to 25 times before applying. Use strong
emulsion, diluted four times in winter, for all scale insects.
For insects which suck, as plant-lice, mealy bugs, red spider,
thrips, bark-lice or scale. Cabbage-worms, currant-worms,
and all insects which have soft bodies can also be successfully
treated.</p>

<p><b>Kohlrabi.</b> This vegetable looks like a leafy
turnip growing above ground. If used when small (2 to 3
inches in diam.), and not allowed to become
hard and tough, it is of superior quality. It
should be more generally grown. The culture
is very simple. A succession of sowings should
be made from early spring until the middle of
summer, in drills 18 inches to 2 feet apart,
thinning the young plants to 6 or 8 inches in
the rows. It matures as quickly as turnips.
One ounce of seed to 100 feet of drill.</p>

<p class="caption">Lantana</p>
</div>

<p><a name="L" id="L"></a><b>Lantana</b> is a popular greenhouse
pot-plant, and is occasionally seen in window-gardens,
being grown for the profusion of its
orange-red, heliotrope-shaped flowers. In the South, and
sometimes in the North, it is planted out for the summer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
It is very easy to grow, and also to propagate by means of
cuttings. Although the flowers of the common species are
ill-scented, the profusion of bloom makes it desirable.</p>

<p><b><a name="larkspur" id="larkspur"></a>Larkspur.</b> <span class="smcap">Delphinium.</span> The Larkspurs are
among the very best hardy plants, being free-flowering and
having a good habit. They should be in every mixed
border, particularly the perennial kinds. The tall flower-spikes,
showing above the cut foliage, give the plant a
striking effect. The flowers are in shades of blue in most
varieties. The plants are propagated by division of root or
from seed. The latter method will give good results, although
the resulting plants are not likely to be the same variety
as the seed plant.</p>

<p>As winter approaches, a covering of coarse litter should
be thrown over the crowns of the perennial kinds. The
plants will come into bloom in late June and continue for a
long season. Plants should be set 3 to 5 feet apart if in rows,
but they are seen to better advantage when mixed with other
border plants. Height of plants from 3 to 5 feet.</p>

<p>The annual Larkspur may be grown from seed sown in
heat and transplanted to the ground in May; or seed may
be sown where the plants are wanted and the seedlings
thinned to 1 foot. These seedlings will bloom in June, and
continue through the summer. Plants grow from 8 to 18
inches high.</p>

<p><b><a name="lawns" id="lawns"></a>Lawns.</b> In order to have a good Lawn, two
things are essential: first, a pleasing surface or contour;
second, a dense, firm sod.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 156px;">
<img src="images/142-fun.jpg" width="156" height="188" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">It is fun to make a garden</p>
</div>

<p>Inasmuch as the Lawn is, or should be, a permanent
thing, it is necessary that the greatest care be exercised to
grade the land and to thoroughly prepare it before any
seeds are sown. About a new building the filling should be
allowed to settle, so that the finished surface will slope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
gradually away from the foundations and the steps. If the
land is very hard clay, or if the place is rather low, it is
always well to lay tile under-drains at frequent intervals.
Everything should be done to cause the land to be deep
and loose, so that the grass roots will run far into the soil
and not be pressed for lack of moisture in a dry time. If
the land has not had applications of manure in
recent years, it is well to plow in, or to spade
in, a liberal quantity of well-rotted litter from
the barnyard. Work this into the soil as deeply
as possible. If the hardpan is rather high, it is
well to subsoil the area or to trench it (that is,
to spade it up two or three spades deep). If the
land is apparently not fertile in plant-food, it is well to
add a dressing of some commercial fertilizer to the surface
when the grass seed is sown. This will start the grass
quickly and allow it to get a foothold before the severe
weather of midsummer comes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 179px;">
<img src="images/142-gardencorner.jpg" width="179" height="310" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A garden corner</p>
</div>

<p>The kind of grass seed to sow will depend upon the region
and also upon the personal tastes of the owner. The
one standard Lawn grass is June grass or blue grass (<i>Poa
pratensis</i>). The seeds of this grass are sold in
the hulls, and therefore the bushel weighs only
fourteen pounds. Not less than two and one-half
to three bushels should be sown to the acre.
In the southern states, June grass will not hold,
and Bermuda grass is used, being sown about as
thick as recommended for the June grass.
There are various prepared Lawn grass
mixtures which are excellent, but the June
grass alone will give a very excellent Lawn
in a short time. Whether one shall sow
white clover in his Lawn depends mostly
upon his personal taste. If he likes the
white clover, it is well to put in a quart or
two of seed to the acre, sowing it separately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
from the June grass in order to get an even distribution.
Some persons like to see the white clover in certain parts
of the Lawn. It thrives very well where the land is rather
moist. In parts of the East, Rhode Island bent grass is
used for lawns.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 174px;">
<img src="images/143-nursery.jpg" width="174" height="103" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A nursery</p>
</div>

<p>The grass seed should be sown in the
cool of the year. It may be sown in September
and thereby become established before
winter; or it may be
sown very early in the
spring. In newly made Lawns, it is a
good plan to grade the area thoroughly
in the fall, allowing it to settle in the
winter; and then, if the surface remains
even, to sow the grass seed on one of the
latest snows in spring. By sowing it on the snow, one can
see that it is distributed evenly; and when the snow
melts, the seed is carried into the land and does not need
covering. It is well to sow three or four quarts per acre
of timothy seed, for the timothy germinates very quickly,
and makes a green area the first season, but is killed out
as soon as the June grass gains a foothold. Timothy
will not stand the continued cutting, whereas the June
grass will. The timothy, therefore, serves as a temporary
covering to the land, indicating where the borders are,
and thereby outlining the area for the Lawn mower to
cut. The timothy seed should be sown separately from the
June grass in order to insure even distribution. On hard
lands it is well to sow two or three quarts per acre of crimson
clover seed. The long roots of this plant tend to improve
the physical condition of the soil; and when they decay,
they leave nitrogen in the soil for the grass to use. Since
crimson clover is an annual plant, it will not do any permanent
mischief in the Lawn.</p>

<p>The first season the weeds will probably come up thickly,
especially if the land is rich. These weeds should not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
be pulled, for whenever one is pulled out of the ground,
many grass plants are rooted up and the surface is made
uneven. The only way in which to keep down weeds is to
mow them frequently with a Lawn mower. They will not
appear in any great numbers the second year, unless there
should be some perennial weeds, like dandelion or dock; and
these may be pulled out the first fall or the following spring.</p>

<p>It is rare that one secures a perfectly good and uniform
sod from one sowing of seed; especially is this true if the
soil varies in different parts of the area. If the surface
contour is satisfactory, it is unwise to dig up the areas
on which the seed has not caught. It is best to rake them
over with a steel rake in fall or spring, sowing on a little
commercial fertilizer rather rich in nitrogen, and sow more
seed. Nearly every Lawn will need patching in this way
from year to year. If the Lawn is attended to in fall and
spring by sowing grass seed, the weeds will rarely do serious
mischief. When weeds are troublesome on the Lawn,
it means that there is not sufficient grass, and every
effort should be made to get more grass. Therefore, when
the perennial weeds are pulled out, sow more grass seed.</p>

<p>When narrow-leaved plantain bothers, it is an indication
that the land is too poor and dry for grass.
In such cases, the land usually lacks humus
or vegetable matter; and in various severe
incursions of the plantain, it may be necessary
to spade up the weedy areas and to work
rotted manure into the soil. Usually, however,
the plantain can be killed out by enriching
the soil and sowing more grass seed.
The common practice of sprinkling Lawns is
nearly always pernicious, since the water is not
supplied in sufficient amount to wet down very far,
and the grass tends to make surface roots. When the
watering is omitted the plants suffer. The more a
Lawn is sprinkled, the more the grass depends upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the sprinkling. If it is necessary to water the Lawn, the
water should be allowed to run directly from the hose until
the surface area is completely soaked. It is best to do this
at nightfall. When the water is applied by means of a
sprinkler, a large part of it evaporates and does no good to
the ground. The fundamental treatment of the Lawn is to
have the land so deep and porous that the grass roots strike
deep into the soil and do not need the surface water. A
Lawn which is well made will need watering only in unusually
dry times.</p>

<p>Mow the Lawn frequently when it is growing rapidly,&mdash;in
spring and early summer. In the fall mow less
frequently, and let it go into the winter with a long coat
of grass. If the Lawn is mown as often as is needed,
it will not be necessary to rake off the trimmings. In fall,
top-dress the Lawn with commercial fertilizer at the rate of
500 pounds to the acre. If the Lawn has not been raked
clean of all the trimmings and decayed refuse which covers
the surface of the ground, it is not necessary to dress it
with stable manure; for manure is unsightly, unsavory, and
often brings in weeds. Many persons make the mistake of
raking the Lawn clean in late fall.</p>

<p>Closely associated with the making of the Lawn is the
general arrangement of the planting. It is the common fault
to scatter the planting. Much better effects are secured by
massing or grouping the planting. See <a href="#border"><i>Borders</i></a> and <a href="#flower_beds"><i>Flower
Beds</i></a>. Particularly along the boundaries and about the
foundations of buildings, the shrubbery and other plants may
be massed to excellent effect. In large places there should
be more or less mass planting along the walks and drives.
In the curves and retreats of these plantings one will find
many pleasant corners; and here the children may have
their play-houses and their pets. A little brook winding
across a corner or along one side of a Lawn may make a
pleasant picture if it is allowed to take on a half-wild
character.</p>

<p class="caption">Several layers from one vine</p>
</div>

<p><b>Layers</b> are parts (usually stems) of plants laid
down on the earth while still attached to the parent, with
the expectation that they will take root and can then be
separated as independent plants. All
vine-like plants can be propagated readily
by means of Layers; so can most soft-wooded
plants, as willows, maples, currants,
etc. It is usual to put down the
branches in the fall. In a year they
should be ready to be severed
from the parent. They may also
be made in spring, before growth
starts. See that the layered part
rests in moist earth. Usually roots
arise more freely if the shoot is cracked or notched at
the buried point. The Layer may be held down by a
forked stick (“pegged down”), or
by a stone or clod. See that the
shoot does not throw up suckers
behind the layered part.</p>

<p><b>Leek.</b> This belongs to the onion family, and is
used mostly as flavoring for soups. Well grown Leeks have
a very agreeable and not very strong onion flavor. Leek is of
the easiest culture, and is usually grown as a second crop, to
follow beets, early peas, and other early stuff. The seed
should be sown in a seed-bed in April or early May and
the seedlings planted out in the garden in July, in rows 2
feet apart, the plants being 6 inches apart in the rows. The
plants should be set deep if the neck or lower part of the
leaves is to be used in a blanched condition. The soil may
be drawn towards the plants in hoeing, to further the
blanching. Being very hardy, the plants may be dug in
late fall, and stored in the same manner as celery, in
trenches or in a cool root-cellar. One ounce of seed to 100
feet of drill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
<b>Lettuce</b> is probably the most extensively grown
salad vegetable. It is now in demand, and is procurable, every
month in the year. The winter and early spring crops are
grown in forcing-houses and coldframes, but a supply from
the garden may be had from April to November, by the use
of a cheap frame in which to grow the first and last crops,
relying on a succession of sowings for the intermediate
supply. Seed for the first crop may be sown in a coldframe
in March, growing the crop thick and having many plants
which are small and tender; or, by thinning out to the distance
of 3 inches and allowing the plants to make a larger
growth, the plants pulled up may be set in the open ground
for the next crop. Sowings should be made in the garden
from April to October, at short intervals. A
moist location should be selected for the July
and August sowings. The early and late sowings
should be of some loose-growing variety,
as they are in edible condition sooner than
the cabbage or heading varieties.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 161px;">
<img src="images/147-lettuce.jpg" width="161" height="99" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Plant of heading lettuce</p>
</div>

<p>The cabbage varieties are far superior to the loose-growing
kinds for salads. To be grown to perfection, they
should have very rich soil, frequent cultivation and an occasional
stimulant, such as liquid manure or nitrate of soda.
The Cos Lettuce is an upright-growing type much esteemed
in Europe, but less grown here. The leaves of the
full grown plants are tied together, thus blanching the center,
making it a desirable salad or garnishing variety. It
thrives best in summer. One ounce of seed will grow 3,000
plants or sow 100 feet of drill. In the garden, plants may
stand 6 inches apart in the rows, and the rows may be as
close together as the system of tillage will allow.</p>

<p><b>Lily.</b> Bulbous plants of many kinds. It has
been said of this family of plants that it has no “poor
relations,” each of them being perfect in itself. Many of
the choicest kinds are comparatively unknown, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
easy to cultivate. In fact, all of the Lilies may be grown
with comparative ease. A light, rich, well-drained soil,
mellow to the depth of at least 1 foot, a handful of sand
under each bulb if the soil is inclined to be stiff, and
planting so that the crown of the bulb will be at least 4
inches below the surface, are the general requirements.
One exception to the depth of planting is <i>Lilium auratum</i>,
or Golden-Banded Lily. This should be planted deeper&mdash;at
least 8 inches below the surface&mdash;as the new bulbs form
over the old one and soon bring the bulbs to the surface if
they are not planted deep.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/148-lily.jpg" width="80" height="233" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Easter Lily</p>
</div>

<p>While Lilies may have partial shade, they should never
be planted near or under trees. The shade or protection of
tall-growing, herbaceous plants is sufficient. In fact, the
best results, both as to growth and effect, may be had by
planting amongst low shrubbery or border plants. Most
kinds are the better for remaining undisturbed for a number
of years; but if they are to be taken up and divided, or
moved to other quarters, they should not be allowed to become
dry. The small bulbs, or offsets, may be planted in
the border, and if protected will grow to flowering
size in two or three years. In taking up bulbs for
division it is best to do so soon after the tops die
after blooming. At least this should be done early
in the fall, not later than October, giving the plants
a chance to become established before freezing
weather. A mulch of coarse litter or evergreen boughs
should be placed over the bulbs after the ground
has become frozen, to be gradually removed as the
spring advances.</p>

<p>As pot-plants some Lilies are very satisfactory,
especially those that may be forced into bloom through
the winter. The best kinds for this purpose are <i>L. Harrisii</i>
(Easter Lily), <i>L. longiflorum</i>, and <i>L. candidum</i>. Others
may be forced with success, but these are the ones most
generally used. The winter culture of these for forcing is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the same as for Hyacinths (in pots), <a href="#hyacinths">which see</a>. The article
on <a href="#bulbs"><i>Bulbs</i></a> gives directions for both outdoor and indoor
growing which are directly applicable to Lilies.</p>

<p><b>Lily, Chinese Sacred.</b> <a href="#narcissus">See <i>Narcissus</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Lily-of-the-Valley.</b> A perfectly hardy little
plant, bearing racemes of small white bell-shaped flowers
in early spring. For ordinary cultivation, sods or mats of
roots may be dug from any place in which the plant is
colonized. Usually it thrives best in partial shade; and
the leaves make an attractive mat on the north side of a
building, or other shady place, in which grass will not
grow. The plants will take care of themselves year after
year.</p>

<p>For forcing indoors, imported roots or “pips” are used,
as the plants are grown for this particular purpose in parts
of Europe. These roots may be planted in pots, and
treated as recommended for winter-flowering bulbs, under
<a href="#bulbs"><i>Bulbs</i></a>. Florists force them in greater heat, however, often
giving them a bottom heat of 80° or 90°; but skill and
experience are required in order to attain uniformly good
results in this case.</p>

<img src="images/149-line.jpg" width="245" height="166" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A garden Line</p>
</div>

<p><b>Line.</b> A garden Line is one of the most convenient
things connected with garden operations. It is
always wanted when long rows of seed are to be
sown, and it is also necessary in laying out walks
or drives. A very simple, yet handy, holder for a
line is shown on the margin. The pin is driven in
the soil at the starting point, and the line is unwound
as the operator walks towards the end of
the row. A line should be 100
feet long for common garden
operations.</p>

<p><b>Lobelia.</b> Some of these are well-known garden
plants, being used very freely as edging for ribbon
beds or basket plants. They require a loose, rich soil, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
some stimulant when in full flower. The flowers continue
through a long season. They propagate freely from seed.
<i>Lobelia Erinus</i>, in blue, 6 inches high, is one of the most
popular of all annual edging plants. In Europe various
perennial Lobelias are popular, but they are seldom seen in
American gardens.</p>

<p><b>London Purple.</b> <a href="#paris_green">Discussed under <i>Paris Green</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Love-Lies-Bleeding.</b> <a href="#amarantus">See <i>Amarantus</i>.</a></p>

<p><a name="M" id="M"></a><b><a name="manure" id="manure"></a>Manure</b> adds plant-food to the soil, and it also
improves the texture or physical condition of the soil. This
latter effect is often its greatest value. If one wants mere
plant-food alone, he may often do better to add it in some
more concentrated form. <a href="#fertilizers">See <i>Fertilizers</i>.</a> Manure, when
thoroughly incorporated with the soil, makes the ground
congenial for the plant. It is important, in garden operations,
that the Manure be rotted or composted, or “short”
or “fine,” as the gardeners say. It then incorporates readily
with the soil and quickly gives up its fertility. Manure is
composted by letting it decay in piles. The compost pile
should be flat on top, so that it will catch the rains, and 3
to 5 feet high.</p>

<p>The most desirable Manure for the garden and for house
plants is probably old cow Manure. It does not burn or lose
its strength. It may be kept for a number of years if piled
under shelter, becoming more available each year. It mixes
well with soil and leaf-mold. When once rotted, this manure
is very lasting and easily assimilated by plants. Horse
Manure is very likely to become overheated, and to lose its
value; and it is too loose and dry for many purposes. Pig
Manure, unless well composted with soil or refuse, is usually
too heavy and rich. Sheep Manure is at its best when used
in a liquid form, although it is most excellent to mix with
soil to loosen it.</p>

<p>All garden refuse, such as vines, leaves, decaying vegetables,
will make Manure if composted with soil; and if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
wash water is thrown on the compost pile much fertility will
be added. Wood ashes from stoves, the chip dirt from the
woodshed&mdash;in fact, almost any substance that will decay&mdash;will
furnish plant-food, and should be added to the compost
pile. This pile should be turned often, to mix the material.</p>

<p>When practicable, it is best to apply Manure in the fall,
as it then has time to become incorporated with the soil before
spring. Beds which are to be used for flowers next year
may be dressed with Manure in the fall and deeply spaded,
leaving the surface rough and loose. It is well to be careful
that the Manure does not contain weed seeds.</p>

<p><b>Marigold.</b> The Marigolds of the old-fashioned
gardens are still among the best of plants for fall color.
They are hardy annuals of the easiest culture, and are always
certain of giving strong and excellent results. They have
been much improved of late years. The old-fashioned
African Marigolds grow 2 to 3 feet high, and they are useful
for scattering in mixed borders or making large masses
or displays of color in the remoter parts of the place. The
French or dwarf Marigolds grow about 1 foot high and are
more tufty in their habit. They are better adapted for edgings
than for mass effects in the main parts of the grounds.
All Marigolds may be sown where the plants are to stand,
since the flowers are usually not wanted until late summer
or early fall, at which time they usually give their best
bloom. If they are wanted earlier, however, the seeds may
be started in the house or hotbed. Tall varieties may be
allowed to stand from 10 to 18 inches apart and the dwarfs
at somewhat less distances.</p>

<p><b>Matthiola</b> will be found under <a href="#stocks"><i>Stocks</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Mignonette.</b> Probably no flower is more generally
grown for its fragrance than this. The Mignonette
needs a cool soil, only moderately rich, shade part of the
day, and careful attention to cutting the flower-stalks before
the seeds are ripe. If a sowing be made in late April, followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
by a second sowing in early July, the season may be
extended until severe frosts. There are few flowers that
will prove as disappointing if the treatment it needs is
omitted. Height 1 to 2 feet. Treated as a half-hardy annual.
It can be sown in pots late in summer and had in the
house in winter.</p>

<p><b>Moon-Flowers</b> are species of Morning-Glories
that open their flowers at night. A well-grown plant
trained over a porch trellis, or allowed to grow at random
over a low tree or shrub, is a striking object when in full
flower at dusk or through a moonlit evening. In the southern
states the Moon-Flower is a perennial, but even when
well protected does not survive the winters in the North.
Cuttings may be made before danger of frost and wintered
in the house, or the plants may be grown from seed sown in
January or February. Cuttings usually give best results in
the northern states, as the seasons are not long enough for
seed plants to give good bloom. Seeds should be scalded or
filed just before sowing. The true Moon-Flower is
<i>Ipomœa Bona-Nox</i>, white-flowered; but there are other
kinds. This grows 20 to 30 feet where the seasons
are long enough.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 115px;">
<img src="images/152-morglry.jpg" width="115" height="212" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Morning-Glories</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="morning-glory" id="morning-glory"></a>Morning-Glory</b> is perhaps the most popular
of all twining herbs, because of the ease with
which it may be grown, the quickness with which
it covers the object, and the quantities of bright,
cheerful flowers it bears. Many of the kinds&mdash;in
fact all that are generally known&mdash;may be readily
grown from seed, flowering early in the summer.
Tender annuals. Give rich soil and plenty of water. The
beautiful cypress vine belongs to this group. It requires the
same treatment as the Morning-Glory, but the seeds should
be scalded just previous to sowing.</p>

<p>Dwarf Morning-Glories (<i>Convolvulus tricolor</i>). They come
into flower much sooner than the tall climbing varieties,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and are covered with flowers through a long season. They
may be used with fine effect in vases or large hanging
baskets. Give a full sunny exposure. May thrive on soil
that is not very rich. They grow 1 foot high. Half-hardy
annuals.</p>

<p><b>Mulberry.</b> Both for fruit and ornament the
Mulberry should be more generally planted. Even if the
fruit is not to the taste, the tree is naturally open-centered
and round-headed, and is an interesting subject; some
of the varieties have finely cut leaves. The fruits are in
great demand by the birds, and after they begin to ripen the
strawberry beds and cherry trees are free from robins and
other fruit-eating birds. For this reason alone they are a
valuable tree for the fruit-grower. Trees may be purchased
cheaper than one can propagate them.</p>

<p>If planted in orchard form, place them 25 to 30 feet
apart. About the borders of a place they can go closer.
The Russian varieties are often planted for windbreaks, for
they are very hardy and thrive under the greatest neglect;
and for this purpose they may be planted 8 to 20 feet
apart. The Russians make excellent screens. They stand
clipping well. New American, Trowbridge and Thorburn
are leading kinds of fruit-bearing Mulberries for the North.
The true Downing is not hardy in the northern states; but
New American is often sold under this name. Mulberries
thrive in any good soil, and need no special treatment.</p>

<p><b><a name="mulch" id="mulch"></a>Mulch</b> is used both in protecting plants from
the severe freezing of winter and the severe drought of
summer. The same material may be used in either case,
although it is now considered best to make an earth Mulch
to prevent evaporation and retain the moisture through the
dry season. This earth Mulch is made by breaking the
crust of the soil and leaving it in fine particles. This may
be done with a horse cultivator, a hoe or a rake. In fact,
any tool which leaves the top of the soil loose will be instrumental
in preventing evaporation of soil water. <a href="#tillage">See
<i>Tillage</i>.</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
The Mulching of the ground around blackberries,
currants, gooseberries, or raspberries with straw or hay is
often practiced to keep the fruits clean; and the winter
Mulch of strawberry beds is used between the rows for the
same purpose, as well as to retain moisture and to afford
winter protection. Winter Mulch usually consists of leaves,
straw, hay, rough manure, boughs of evergreens, or any
coarse material that will protect the plants from severe
freezing and the heaving caused by alternate freezing and
thawing. This winter Mulch should be removed as spring
advances, unless it is of such a character as to be
worked into the soil to add fertility or to loosen heavy
lands. Near the seacoast salt hay is considered to be an
ideal Mulch. The winter Mulch must not contain too strong
or heavy manures, or plants may be injured by the leaching.
For flower borders and shrubbery, muck or peat makes a
good winter Mulch. Ordinarily the Mulch may be placed on
to the depth of 4 to 6 inches, and if it is of loose material it
may be still deeper. If dry and loose, mice may nest in it
and girdle the trees or bushes. Even perfectly hardy plants
are benefited by a winter Mulch, because it improves the
soil. Autumn leaves, as they drift into shrubberies, make
an ideal Mulch; it is not always necessary to remove these
leaves. <a href="#lawns">See <i>Lawn</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Mushroom.</b> There is no science of Mushroom
growing. Certain conditions have been found to give
success, but it is not known why. These conditions may be
imitated ever so closely and complete failure result. There
are many “systems” advised, each system the result of
somebody’s success; but one cannot be sure of success by
following any one of them. Good results are frequently attained
when all rules are broken. The following paragraphs
are from “Farmers’ Bulletin,” No. 53 (by William Falconer),
of the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture (March, 1897):</p>

<p>Mushrooms are a winter crop, coming in from September
till April or May&mdash;that is, the work of preparing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
manure begins in September and ends in February, and the
packing of the crop begins in October or November and ends
in May. Under extraordinary conditions the season may
begin earlier and last longer, and, in fact, it may continue
all summer.</p>

<p>Mushrooms can be grown almost anywhere out of doors,
and also indoors where there is a dry bottom in which to set
the beds, where a uniform and moderate
temperature can be maintained, and where
the beds can be protected from wet overhead,
and from winds, drought, and direct
sunshine. Among the most desirable places
in which to grow Mushrooms are barns, cellars,
closed tunnels, sheds, pits, greenhouses,
and regular Mushroom houses. Total
darkness is not imperative, for Mushrooms grow well in
open light if shaded from sunshine. The temperature and
moisture are more apt to be equable in dark places than in
open, light ones, and it is largely for this reason that
Mushroom houses are kept dark.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 173px;">
<img src="images/155-mushroom.jpg" width="173" height="130" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Mushroom</p>
</div>

<p>The best fertilizer for Mushrooms, so far as the writer’s
experience goes, is fresh horse manure. Get together a lot
of this material (short and strawy) that has been well
trampled and wetted in the stable. Throw it into a heap,
wet it well if it is at all dry, and let it heat. When it begins
to steam turn it over, shake it well so as to mix thoroughly
and evenly, and then tramp it down solid. After this let it
stand till it again gets quite warm, then turn, shake, trample
as before, and add water freely if it is getting dry. Repeat
this turning, moistening and trampling as often as it is
needful to keep the manure from “burning.” If it gets intensely
hot, spread it out to cool, after which again throw it
together. After being turned in this way several times, and
the heat in it is not apt to rise above 130° F., it should be
ready to make up in the beds. By adding to the manure at the
second or third turning one-fourth or one-fifth of its bulk of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
loam, the tendency to intense heating is lessened and its
usefulness not at all impaired. Some growers prefer short
manure exclusively, that is, the horse droppings, while others
like a good deal of straw mixed in with this. The writer’s
experience, however, is that, if properly prepared, it matters
little which is used.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the beds are only 8 to 10 inches deep; that is,
they are faced with 10-inch-wide hemlock boards, and are
only the depth of this board. In such beds put a layer of
fresh, moist, hot manure, and trample it down firm until it
constitutes half the depth of the bed; then fill up with the
prepared manure, which should be rather cool (100° to 115°
F.) when used, and pack all firmly. If desired, the beds can
be made up entirely of the prepared manure. Shelf beds are
usually 9 inches deep; that is, the shelf is bottomed with
1-inch boards and faced with 10-inch-wide boards. This allows
about 8 inches for manure, and 1 inch rising to 2 inches
of loam on top. In filling the shelf beds the bottom half may
be of fresh, moist or wettish, hot manure, packed down solid,
and the top half of rather cool prepared manure, or it may
be made up of all prepared manure. As the shelf beds can
not be trodden and can not be beaten very firm with the back
of the fork, a brick is used in addition to the fork.</p>

<p>The beds should be spawned after the heat in them has
fallen below 100° F. The writer considers 90° F. about the
best temperature for spawning. If the beds have been
covered with hay, straw, litter or mats, these should be
removed. Break each brick into twelve or fifteen pieces.
The rows should be, say, 1 foot apart, the first one being 6
inches from the edge, and the pieces should be 9 inches
apart in the row. Commencing with the first row, lift up
each piece, raise 2 to 3 inches of the manure with the
hand, and into this hole place the piece, covering over
tightly with the manure. When the entire bed is spawned
pack the surface all over. It is well to cover the beds
again with straw, hay or mats, to keep the surface equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
moist. The flake spawn is planted in the same way as the
brick spawn, only not quite so deep.</p>

<p>At the end of eight or nine days the mulching should be
removed and the beds covered with a layer of good loam 2
inches thick, so that the Mushrooms can come up in and
through it. This gives them a firm hold, and to a large extent
improves their quality and texture. Any fair loam will
do. That from an ordinary field, wayside or garden is
generally used, and it answers admirably. There exists an
idea that garden soil surfeited with old manure is unfit for
Mushroom beds because it is apt to produce spurious fungi.
This, however, is not the case. In fact, it is the earth most
commonly used. For molding the beds the loam should be
rather fine, free and mellow, so that it can be easily and
evenly spread and compacted firmly into the manure.</p>

<p>If an even atmospheric temperature of from 55° to 60° F.
can be maintained, and the house or cellar containing the
Mushroom beds is kept close and free from drafts, the beds
may be left uncovered, and should be watered if they become
dry. But no matter where the beds are situated, it is well to
lay some loose hay or straw or some old matting or carpet
over them to keep them moist. The covering, however,
should be removed just as soon as the young Mushrooms
begin to appear above ground. If the atmosphere is dry,
the pathways and walls should be sprinkled with water.
The mulching should also be sprinkled, but not enough to
cause the water to soak into the bed. However, if the bed
should get dry, do not hesitate to water it.</p>

<p><b><a name="melon" id="melon"></a>Muskmelon.</b> The natural soil for melons is
a light, sandy loam, well enriched with rotted manure,
although good crops may be grown on soil naturally heavy
if the hills are prepared as they should be. When only
heavy soil is available, the dirt where the seeds are to be
planted should be thoroughly pulverized and mixed with
fine, well rotted manure. A sprinkling of leaf-mold or
chip-dirt will help to lighten it. On this hill from ten to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
fifteen seeds may be sown, thinning to four or five vines
when danger of insects is over. The season may be advanced
and the damage from insects lessened by starting the
plants in hotbeds. This may be done by using fresh sod,
cut into 6-inch pieces, placing them grass-side down in the
hotbed, sowing eight to ten seeds on each piece, and covering
with 2 inches of light soil. When all danger of frost is
over, and the ground has become warm, these sods may be
carefully lifted and set in the prepared hills. The plants
usually grow without check, and fruit from two
to four weeks ahead of those from seed planted
directly in the hill. Old quart berry boxes are
excellent to plant seeds in, as, when they are
set in the ground, they very quickly decay,
causing no restriction to the roots. Netted
Gem, Hackensack, Emerald Gem, Montreal, Osage, and
the Nutmeg Melon are popular varieties. One ounce of
seed will plant about fifty hills.</p>

the daffodils, jonquils, and other forms. The ease with
which these plants may be grown, the beauty and fragrance
of the flowers, as well as their lasting qualities when cut,
would seem to make their culture in this country more
popular than it is. Good bulbs planted in September or
October are sure to bloom in April or May. The bulbs may
remain in the ground for a number of years, although the
best results will be had by digging them up every three
years, and resetting in a different location. Select a moist,
loamy soil, slightly protected from the sun. No manure
should come directly in contact with the bulb, but if needed
to hold moisture the manure may be spaded down to the
depth of twelve inches.</p>

Narcissus may be forced into flower through the winter,
as described under <a href="#bulbs"><i>Bulbs</i></a>. The most popular for winter
bloom is the “Chinese Sacred Lily.” This
grows in water without any soil whatever.
Secure a bowl or glass dish, about three times
the size of the bulb; put some pretty stones
in the bottom; set in the bulb and build up
around it with stones so as to hold it stiff when
the leaves have grown; tuck two or three small
pieces of charcoal among the stones to keep
the water sweet, then fill up the dish with
water and add a little every few days, as it
evaporates. Set the dish in a warm, light
place. In about six weeks
the fragrant, fine white flowers
will fill the room with perfume.</p>

<p><b><a name="nasturtiums" id="nasturtiums"></a>Nasturtiums</b> (<i>Tropæolums</i>) are
both dwarf and climbing. The Dwarf
Nasturtiums make one of the most showy
second-row plants for the border. The
colors of the flowers have a wide range
and the plants bloom profusely. It is
not, however, the plant in flower that is
the greatest consideration, but the flowers
themselves as cut-flowers. No flower
makes a finer display in vase or bowl
than these rich colors, all harmonizing
well and lighting up a room as very few
of the common easily grown flowers do.
The same may be said of the tall-growing
Nasturtiums, although the flowers of
these form part of their effectiveness
as screen vines. Few climbers make a
more rapid growth, and none are better
adapted to hide unsightly objects in our
yards or gardens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>For a long season of flowers and a large growth of vine
the seed should be sown late in March or early in April,
in boxes or pots, the plants carried along until the first
of May, and planted out where wanted. The
dwarf varieties bloom more freely and the flowers
are of better color in rather poor soils, while for
rapid growth of vine a well enriched border would
be the best. The dwarf varieties may be planted
2 or 3 feet apart, and the tall ones as wanted to
make a screen. The tall kinds grow 5 to 8 feet.
All Nasturtiums are tender.</p>

<p><b>Nicotiana.</b> Tender annuals (or grown
as annuals). They are fine plants for borders or
pots, the tall-growing varieties making a very fine show
when in flower, having pure white flowers with long, tubular
necks, the season of bloom being from July to
October. The seeds are very fine, and should be
sown on the surface of the soil, in boxes or pots.
When planted out they should be set from 2 to 5
feet apart, according to kind. Some of the giant
Nicotianas are excellent subjects for temporary
screens; so is tobacco, which is also a Nicotiana.</p>

<p><i>Nicotiana affinis</i> is one of the best of all garden
flowers. Its long white flowers are fragrant at
evening. They close in the hot sun. It is a half-hardy

<p><b>Okra.</b> From the green pods of this vegetable
is made the well-known Gumbo soup of the South, where the
plant is more extensively grown than in the North. The pods
are also used in their green state for stews, and are dried and
used in winter, when they are nutritious, and
form no little part of the diet in certain sections
of the country. The seeds are very sensitive
to cold and moisture, and should not be sown
until the ground has become warm&mdash;the last
week in May or the first of June being early
enough in New York. The seed should be sown
in a drill 1 inch deep, the plants thinned to
stand 12 inches in the row. Give the same culture
as for corn. One ounce will sow 40 feet of drill.
Dwarf varieties are best for the North. Green Density
and Velvet are leading varieties.</p>

<p><b>Oleander.</b> While there are many named varieties
of the Oleander, but two are often seen in general
cultivation. These are the common red and white varieties.
Both these, as well as the named varieties, are of
easy management and well adapted to home culture, growing
in pots or tubs for several years without special care.
Well-grown specimens are very effective as porch or lawn
plants, or may be used to good advantage in mixed beds of
tall-growing plants, plunging the pot or tub to the rim in the
soil. The plants should be cut back after flowering. They
should be rested in any out-of-the-way place through the
winter. When brought out in the spring, they should be
given sun and air in order to make a sturdy growth. Propagation
is effected by using well-ripened wood for cuttings,
placed in a close frame; or the slips may be rooted in
a bottle or can of water, care being taken to supply water as
evaporation takes place. After being rooted, they may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
potted, using soil with a large proportion of sand. Well
established plants may be repotted in good loam and well
rotted manure.</p>

<p><b>Onions</b> are grown from seeds (“black seed”)
for the main crop. They are also grown from sets (which
are very small Onions, arrested in their development), from
“tops” (which are bulblets produced in the place of flowers),
and from multipliers or potato onions, which are compound
bulbs.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 104px;">
<img src="images/162-onions.jpg" width="104" height="251" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Early Onions</p>
</div>

<p>The extremely early crop of Onions is grown from sets,
and the late or fall crop is grown from seed sown in April
or early May. The sets may be saved from the crop harvested
the previous fall, saving no bulbs measuring over ¾
of an inch in diameter, or, better, they may be purchased
from the seedsman. These sets should be
planted as early as possible in the spring, preferably
on land that has been manured and trenched in the
fall. Plant in rows 12 inches apart, the sets being 2
or 3 inches in the row. Push the sets well down into
the ground and cover with soil, firming them with the
feet or a roller. In cultivating, the soil should be
thrown towards the tops, as the white stems are
usually sought as an indication of mildness. The
crop will be in condition to use in from three to
four weeks, and may be made to last until small
seed Onions are to be had. Tops or multipliers
may also be used for the early crop.</p>

<p>In growing Onions from seed, it is only necessary to say
that the seed should be in the ground very early in order
that the bulbs make their growth before the extreme hot
weather of August, when, for want of moisture and because
of the heat, the bulbs will ripen up while small.
Early in April, in New York, if the ground is in condition,
the seed should be sown thickly in drills from 12 to 16 inches
apart, and the ground above the seeds well firmed. Good
cultivation and constant weeding is the price of a good crop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of Onions. In cultivating and hoeing, the soil should be
kept away from the rows, not covering the growing bulbs,
but allowing them to spread over the surface of the ground.
When the crop is ready to be harvested, the bulbs may
be pulled or cultivated up, left to dry in double rows for
several days, the tops and roots taken off, and the bulbs
stored in a dry place. Later in the season they may be
allowed to freeze, covering with chaff or straw to hold them
frozen, and kept until early spring; but this method is
usually unsafe with beginners, and always so in a changeable
climate. Onion seed should always be fresh when sown&mdash;preferably
of the last year’s crop. One ounce of Onion
seed will sow 100 feet of drill.</p>

<p>One of the recent methods of obtaining extra large bulbs
from seed is to sow the seed in a hotbed in February or
early March, and transplant to the open ground in April.</p>

<p>The Danvers, Prizetaker, Globe and Wethersfield are
favorite varieties, with the addition of White Queen or
Barletta for pickling.</p>

<p><b>Oxalis.</b> A number of hardy species of this
are excellent plants for rockwork and edging. The greenhouse
species are very showy, growing without extra care,
and blooming freely through the late winter and spring
months; these are mostly increased by bulbs, a few by division
of the root. <i>O. violacea</i> is one of the commonest of
house-plants. Give a sunny window, for the flowers open
only in sun or very bright light. The bulbous kinds are
treated as recommended for <a href="#bulbs"><i>Bulbs</i></a>, except that the bulbs
must not freeze.</p>

<p><a name="P" id="P"></a><b><a name="palms" id="palms"></a>Palms.</b> No more graceful plant for room
decoration can be found than a well-grown specimen of
some species of Palms. Most Palms are well adapted for
this purpose when small, and as the growth is usually very
slow, a plant may be used for many years. Again, the
plants thrive better in partial shade. They may be grown
in a sitting or drawing-room more satisfactorily than most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
house-plants. One of the frequent causes of failure in the
culture of the Palm is the over-potting and subsequent over-watering.
A Palm should not be repotted until the mass of
roots fills the soil; then a pot only a size
larger should be used. Use ample drainage
in the bottom to carry off excess of
water. Although the plants need a moist
soil, water standing at their roots proves
injurious. A soil composed of well rotted
sod, leaf-mold and a little sand will meet
their requirements. Among the best
Palms for house culture are Arecas,
<i>Cocos Weddelliana</i>, Latania, Kentia,
Chamærops and Phœnix. Cycas may
also be regarded as a Palm.</p>

<p>The date Palm may be grown from

Seed of the other varieties may be purchased
from leading seedsmen, but, as
the seed germinates only under favorable
conditions, and the Palm is a very
slow-growing plant while young, the
best plan is to purchase the plants from
a dealer when wanted. When the
plants become weak or diseased, take them to a florist for
treatment and recuperation.</p>

well adapted to house culture. The singular habit of
growth, bright, glossy leaves, and the ability to withstand
the dust and shade of a dwelling room, make them a desirable
addition to the house collection. They are propagated
by the offsets or young plants that grow around the
base of the trunk; or they may be increased by seed. If by
the former method, the offsets should be cut off and set in
sand, at a temperature of 65° or 70°. The cuttings root<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>

</div>

<p><b>Pansy</b> is without doubt the most popular spring
flower in cultivation. The strains of seed are many, each
containing great possibilities. The culture is simple and
the results are sure. Seed sown in August or September, in
boxes or a frame, will make plants large enough to reset
in November and bloom the following March; or they may
be left until March in open seed-beds before setting out.
Also, if they are sown very thinly in the frames they may
remain undisturbed through the winter, blooming very early
the following spring. The frame
should be protected by mats, boards
or other covering through the severe
cold, and as the sun gains strength,
care should be taken to keep them
from heaving by alternate thawing
and freezing. Seed sown in boxes
in January or February will make
fine blooming plants by April, taking
the place of those blooming
earlier.</p>

<p>The requisites for satisfactory Pansy culture are rich,
moist, cool soil, protection from the noonday sun, and attention
to keeping them from going to seed. As the ground
becomes warm a mulch of leaf-mold or other light material
should be spread over the bed to retain moisture
and exclude heat. Spring and fall give the best bloom.</p>

<p><b><a name="paris_green" id="paris_green"></a>Paris Green</b> is the leading arsenical insecticide.
It is usually applied in a water spray, at the rate of
1 pound of the poison to 150 to 200 gallons of water. Add ½
pound of lime to prevent injury to foliage. Potatoes will
usually stand a stronger mixture; peaches and some other
plants do not need one so strong. Make the Paris Green into
a paste with water before adding it to the 200 gallons, that it
may mix better. Paris Green may be added to Bordeaux<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
mixture with excellent results, counting the Bordeaux as if
it were so much water; in this case it will not be necessary
to add lime to the Paris Green. The Paris Green is
used only for chewing insects, as worms and beetles. London
purple is used in the same way.</p>

<p class="caption">Parsley grown in a box</p>
</div>

<p><b>Parsley.</b> The curled Parsley is used almost
exclusively as a garnish for meats and salads, although the
flavor in soups is fine. The seed is slow to germinate, and
often the second or third sowing is made, thinking the first
is a failure; but usually after what would seem
a long time the young plants will be seen.
When sown in the open ground, it should be
thinned to stand 3 or 4 inches in the row, the
rows being 10 to 12 inches apart. A few plants
in a border will give a supply for a large family,
and with a little protection will live over winter. Roots
may be lifted in the fall, put into boxes or old cans, and
grown in a sunny window for winter use.</p>

<p><b>Parsnips</b> are one of the vegetables that are
the better for the winter’s freeze, although they are of good
quality if taken up after the fall frosts and packed in soil,
sand or moss in the cellar. The seed, which must be not
over one year old, should be sown as early as possible in
well prepared soil, firmed with the feet or roller. As the
seed germinates rather slowly the ground often becomes
crusted or baked over the seeds, in which case it should be
broken and fined with a garden rake. This operation often
means the success of the crop. Radish or cabbage seeds
may be sown with the Parsnip seed to mark the row and
break the crust. One ounce of seed will sow 200 feet of
drill. Thin to 6 inches apart in the row.</p>

<p><b>Pea.</b> Who does not long for the time when
early Peas are fit to use? And how many know the great
difference in quality between the smooth and the wrinkled
Peas? The first are a little the earliest to be planted and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to become fit for use, and on that account should be
planted in a small way. For the kitchen-garden the dwarf
and half-dwarf varieties are the best, as the tall kinds will
need brush or wire to support them, causing considerable
trouble and labor and not being as neat in appearance. The
tall varieties yield a larger crop than the dwarfs, but as the
rows must be made from 3 to 5 feet apart, the dwarf ones,
which are planted only 6 to 8 inches apart, will give as
large a yield on the same area. Always plant double rows
of the tall varieties: that is, two rows from 4 to 6 inches
apart, with the brush or wire between, the double rows
being from 3 to 5 feet apart, according to varieties. The
dwarf varieties should be planted four rows in a block, each
row being only 6 or 8 inches apart. The Peas on the two
center rows may be picked from the outside. Leave a
space of 2 feet and plant the same. At the time of the first
planting only the smooth varieties should be sown, but by
the middle of April in New York the ground will be warm
and dry enough for the wrinkled sorts. A succession should
be sown that will come to maturity one after the other, extending
the season six or eight weeks. If a further supply
is wanted the early quick-maturing varieties may be sown
in August, usually giving a fair crop of Peas in September
and early October. In the hot weather of midsummer they
often do not thrive so well. One quart of seed will plant
about 100 feet of drill.</p>

<p><b><a name="pea_everlasting" id="pea_everlasting"></a>Pea, Everlasting</b> (<i>Lathyrus latifolius</i>). These
Peas do not have the colors or fragrance of the Sweet Pea,
but are fine for planting against rocks, stumps, or fences.
They bloom through a long season, and, being perfectly
hardy, will live for years. Height 2 to 6 feet. Raised from
seeds or from cuttings, usually the former. Keep the seed
pods picked off to lengthen period of bloom.</p>

<p><b>Peach.</b> Given the proper exposure, Peaches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
may be fruited in many sections where now it is thought
impossible to have a crop. It is usually the practice of the
amateur to set Peach trees in the shelter of some building,
exposed on the south or east to the sun, and “in a pocket”
as regards winds. This should be reversed, except in the
close vicinity of large bodies of water. The fruit buds of
Peaches will stand very cold weather when perfectly dormant,
often as low as 12° or 18° below zero in New
York; but if the buds once become swollen, comparatively
light freezing will destroy the crop. Therefore, if the trees
be set on elevations where a constant air drainage may be
obtained, sheltered, if at all, on the south
and east, from the warming influence of
the sun, the buds will remain dormant
until the ground becomes warm, and the
chances of a failure will be lessened. This
advice applies mostly to interior sections.
A well drained, sandy loam or gravelly soil
suits the Peach better than a heavy soil; but if the heavier
soil is well drained, good crops may be obtained.</p>

<p class="caption">Peaches</p>
</div>

<p>Peaches are short-lived at best, and one should be satisfied
with three or four crops from each tree. They bear
young, usually a partial crop the third year. If a crop may
be had every other year until the trees are eight or ten
years old, they will have well repaid the effort of cultivation.
But they often bear twice this long. Young trees may be
set every four or five years to replace older ones, thus
having trees at a bearing age at all times on a small place.
Trees should be set 14 to 18 feet apart each way. A good
selection of varieties for home use would be Early York,
Alexander, Halo Early, Mountain Rose, Early Crawford,
Wheatland, Stump, Elberta, Stevens, Oldmixon, Late Crawford
and Smock.</p>

<p>Peach trees are always bought when they are one year
old, that is, one year from the bud. For example, the bud
is set in the fall of 1898. It remains dormant until the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
spring of 1899, when it pushes into vigorous growth; and in
the fall of 1899 the tree is ready for sale. Peach trees
which are more than a year old are scarcely worth the
buying. It is a common practice, when setting Peach trees,
to prune them back to a whip, leaving a stub bearing not
more than one bud where each branch is cut off.</p>

<p>The three great enemies of the Peach are the borer, the
yellows and the curculio.</p>

<p>The borer is best handled by digging it out every spring
and fall. Trees which are attacked by the borer have an
exudation of gum about the crown. If the borers are dug
out twice a year they will not get sufficient start to make
the operation very laborious. It is the only sure way.</p>

<p>The yellows is a communicable disease, the cause of
which is not definitely known. It shows itself in the fruit
ripening prematurely, with distinct red spots which extend
through the flesh, and later by the throwing out of fine,
branching, twiggy tufts along the main branches. The
only treatment is to pull out the trees and burn them.
Other trees may be set in the same places.</p>

<p>For a discussion of curculio, see the remarks under
<a href="#plum"><i>Plum</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Pear.</b> No fruit plantation should be considered
complete without trees of various kinds of Pears, ripening
fruits from early in August till winter. The late varieties
are generally good keepers, and extend the season into
February, thus supplying fruit for six or seven months.</p>

<p>As the Pear grows to perfection on quince, the dwarf tree
is peculiarly adapted to planting on small home grounds,
and is often used as a boundary plant, or to serve the purpose
of a screen. These dwarf trees should be set deep&mdash;4
to 6 inches below the union&mdash;to prevent the stock from
growing. Dwarf trees may be set as near together as 10
to 16 feet, while the standard or tall-growing Pears should
be set 18 to 25 feet apart. Trees are planted when two or
three years old.</p>

<p class="caption">Bartlett Pears</p>
</div>

<p>The Pear thrives on clay soil, if well underdrained, and
for this reason may succeed in places where other fruits
might fail. A good, steady growth should be maintained,
but the use of nitrogenous manures should be avoided, as
they tend to make a rank growth and invite attacks of Pear
blight, which is the worst enemy of the Pear.
For summer fruits: Osband’s Summer, Bartlett,
Clapp and Manning Elizabeth are among
the best. For autumn: Duchess, Flemish
Beauty, Bosc, Louise Bonne, Seckel and
Sheldon. For winter fruit: Anjou, Clairgeau,
Lawrence and Winter Nelis are excellent.
Kieffer is an excellent commercial fruit, but it
is too poor to be given space in the home
ground except as an ornamental tree.</p>

<p>Of the Pear blight, Duggar writes as follows:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Remedies.</span> (<i>a</i>) <i>The knife and the saw.</i>&mdash;With a disease
working as this does, it is very evident that there is
no chance either for cure or prevention by means of spraying.
The heroic treatment of the knife and saw must be
adopted and vigorously pursued, as has been claimed from
the beginning. The blackened leaves alone must not
serve as signs of the diseased area, but one must examine
carefully the branches and remove them 6 inches or more
below the lowest discolorations. Often before cutting,
pruners slice the bark downward to see where the injury
ends. This should not be done; it is better to be sure that
you are below the infected area, and run no such risk of
infecting anew the tissues below. The cut surfaces of
larger limbs and branches should be painted for protection
against wound rots.</p>

<p>“(<i>b</i>) <i>When to cut.</i>&mdash;Cutting out diseased portions
should be done whenever the disease is evident. This may
check the injuries temporarily; but it has been shown that
much can be done in the autumn to prevent the establishment
of the disease the following spring. It has long been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
known that the disease may pass the winter in the branches
by a slow growth in the neighborhood of late infections.
Thorough work of eradication should especially be performed
after the season of growth. Then cut out every
diseased branch and burn, so that in the spring when the
succulent growth begins again, there will be few places in
which insects may come in contact with the bacterial
exudations.</p>

<p>“(<i>c</i>) <i>Conditions favoring the disease.</i>&mdash;The knife is our
only hope of extermination; but there are undoubtedly conditions
which favor the disease. In a succulent, rapidly
growing tree the bacteria find more favorable conditions for
their development than in one which grows slowly, yet with
sufficient vigor. For this reason, too much nitrogenous
manure is dangerous; and, for the same reason, a succulent
growth induced by severe pruning should be avoided.”</p>

<p class="caption">Pelargonium, or
Geranium</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="pelargoniums" id="pelargoniums"></a>Pelargoniums.</b> Here belong the plants known
as Geraniums&mdash;the most satisfactory of house-plants, and
extensively used as bedding plants. No plants will give
better returns in leaf and flower; and these features, added
to the ease of propagation, make them general favorites.
Cuttings of partially ripened wood root very easily,
grow to blooming size in a short time, and, either
planted out or grown in a pot, make fine decorations.
The common or “Fish” Geraniums are
much more satisfactory when not more than a
year old. Take cuttings from the old plants at
least once a year. In four or five months the
young plants begin to bloom. Plants may be
taken up from the garden and potted, but they
rarely give as much satisfaction as young, vigorous
subjects. Repot frequently until they are in 4- to 5-inch
pots; then let them bloom.</p>

<p>The show Pelargoniums are those commonly known as
Lady Washington Geraniums. These have but one period
of bloom, usually in April, but they make up in size and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
coloring. This section is more difficult to manage as a
house plant than the common Geranium, needing more direct
light to keep it stocky, and being troubled by insects.
Still, all the trouble taken to grow them will be well repaid
by the handsome blossoms. Take cuttings in late spring,
after flowering, and blooming plants may be had the following
year. Good results are sometimes secured by keeping
these plants two or three years. Cut back after each
blooming season.</p>

<p>For house culture the Geraniums need a rich, fibrous
loam, with the addition of a little sand; good drainage is
also an essential.</p>

<p><b>Peony.</b> The herbaceous Peony has long had
a place in the garden, and is now in general use as an early
flowering plant. It is perfectly hardy, and free from the
many diseases and insects that attack so many fine plants.
The single and semi-double varieties are very fine, the
flowers becoming large as the plant becomes well established.
The herbaceous section is readily increased by division.
The tree Peonies are increased by grafting. They grow
in some cases to the height of 3 or more feet, and are covered
with large, very double flowers of rich colors.
Height 2 to 3 feet.</p>

<p class="caption">Bell Pepper</p>
</div>

<p><b>Peppers</b> are tender while young, although
they will endure a heavy frost in the fall. Their
culture is that recommended for eggplants. A small
seedsman’s packet of seed will be sufficient for a large
number of plants, say two hundred. The large Bell
Peppers are the mildest, and are used for making
“stuffed Peppers” and other dishes. The small, hot
Peppers are used for seasoning and sauces.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 182px;">
<img src="images/173-petunia.jpg" width="182" height="125" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Petunia</p>
</div>

<p><b>Petunia.</b> The improvement made in the size
and markings of the Petunia has been marked of late. Now
almost every shade of color may be found, aside from yellow.
A bed of Petunias makes a mass of color equaled by few other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
flowers. They also make very fine single plants for pots,
baskets or window-boxes, blooming freely through the winter,
and emitting a delicate fragrance. The single varieties
grow freely from seed, but if plants of one
special color are wanted cuttings should be
made. These cuttings root easily and bloom
early. Cuttings will have to be made of
the double varieties to increase their number.
For common Petunias, sow seeds where
plants are to grow, in a warm, sunny place;
or, for earlier bloom, seeds may be started
in the house. Thin to 8 to 12 inches apart. The season
of bloom is cut short only by frost or other causes.</p>

<p><b>Phlox.</b> Both the perennial and the annual
Phloxes are most valuable. Excepting the petunia, no plant
will give the profusion of bloom with as little care as the
annual Phlox (<i>Phlox Drummondii</i>). Masses of one color or
of contrasting colors make very effective ribbon borders or
edging beds. The perennial species are very showy, having
almost as wide a range of color as the annuals. They grow
to the height of 3 feet. They are most effective in the back
row of a border. The perennials have been much improved
of late. They are hardy.</p>

<p>The annual Phlox is propagated by seed sown early in the
spring in the border, or in March in boxes and transplanted.
The perennial Phlox is increased by division of the roots,
the flowers being larger and more highly colored by dividing
at least every three years. The annual Phlox blooms early,
and continues until late in the fall. The perennial blooms
from July to frost.</p>

<p><b>Pink.</b> See <a href="#dianthus"><i>Dianthus</i></a> and <a href="#carnations"><i>Carnation</i></a>.</p>

<p><b><a name="plum" id="plum"></a>Plum.</b> Of Plums there are three general or
common types: first, the common Domestica or European
Plum, which gives rise to all the older varieties, like Lombard,
Bradshaw, Green Gage, the Prunes, the Egg Plums,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the Damsons, and the like; second, the Japanese Plums,
which have become popular within the last ten years, and
which are adapted to a wider range of country than the
Domesticas; third, the native Plums of several species or
types, which are adapted to the plains, the middle and
southern states, where the Domestica Plums do not thrive,
and some kinds to the cold North.</p>

<p>Wherever the Domestica and Japanese Plums can be
grown, the native Plums are not destined to become popular;
but many of the natives are much hardier than others,
and are therefore adapted to regions in which the Domestica
and Japanese are not safe. Others of them are well adapted
to the middle and southern states. The Domestica and
Japanese Plums are considerably hardier than peaches, but
not so hardy as the apple. The northern limit of their general
cultivation is the southern peninsula of Michigan, central
and southern Ontario, central New York and central
New England.</p>

<p>Plums thrive on a great variety of soils, but they do
better, as a rule, on those which are rather heavy and have
a considerable content of clay. In fact, many of the varieties
will thrive on clay as hard as that upon which pears
will grow. On the other hand, they often thrive well upon
light, and even almost sandy soils.</p>

<p>The trees are set when they are two and three years from
the bud. It is preferable to have Plum trees on stocks of
the same species, but it is not always possible to secure them
at the nurseries. In the South, Plums are worked mostly on
peach roots, and these make excellent trees where the
climate is not too severe, and especially upon the lighter
lands on which they are planted in the South. In the North
the larger part of the Plum stocks are grown on the
Myrobalan Plum roots. This Myrobalan is an Old World
species of Plum, of smaller growth than the Domestica.
This stock, therefore, tends to dwarf the tree, and it is
also likely to throw up sprouts from the roots. Plum trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
are set from 12 to 18 feet apart. Many growers like to set
them 8 feet apart in rows, and have the rows from 16 to 20
feet apart.</p>

<p>Plums are pruned much the same as apples and
pears. That is, the top is thinned out from year to year,
and all superfluous branches and broken or diseased wood
are removed. If the soil is very strong and the trees are
close together, it may be well to head them in a little each
year, especially those varieties which grow very strong
and robust.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/175-plums.jpg" width="229" height="196" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Plums</p>
</div>

<p>The varieties of Plums are very numerous. Of the
Domestica or European type, some of the best are Bradshaw,
Imperial Gage, Jefferson, Reine Claude, Coe Golden
Drop, Quackenbos, Fellemburg, German Prune, Copper.
The Lombard is the most cosmopolitan variety, and is
always sure to give a crop, but the quality is not so good as
that of the others mentioned. For
culinary purposes, some of the Damsons,
which are very small-fruited
varieties, are excellent. Of Japanese
Plums, the best so far tested for the
North are Red June, Abundance, Burbank,
Chabot and Satsuma. For a
very early cherry-like Plum for home
use, the Berger is excellent. Of the
native Plums, the most cosmopolitan
variety is Wild Goose. Excellent
varieties are Weaver, Quaker, Forest Garden, Wayland, and
others.</p>

<p>There are four leading difficulties in the growing of Plums&mdash;leaf
blight, fruit rot, black knot, and curculio.</p>

<p>The leaf blight usually comes on about midsummer, the
leaves becoming spotted and dropping off. The remedy for
this trouble is to spray thoroughly with Bordeaux mixture,
beginning soon after the fruits have set, and before the
trouble begins to show.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
The fruit rot may be prevented by the same means&mdash;that
is, by spraying with Bordeaux mixture. It is usually best
to begin just after the fruits are well set. A very important
consideration in the checking of this disease is to thin the
fruit so that it does not hang in clusters. If one fruit touches
another, the rot spreads from fruit to fruit in spite of the
spraying. Some varieties, like Lombard and Abundance,
are susceptible to this injury.</p>

<p>The black knot is best kept in check by cutting out the
knots whenever they can be seen, and burning them. As
soon as the leaves drop, the orchard should be gone over
and all knots taken out. Orchards which are thoroughly
sprayed with Bordeaux mixture for the leaf blight and fruit-rot
fungus are less liable to attacks of black knot.</p>

<p>The curculio, or the insect which is the parent of the
worms in the fruit, is the inveterate enemy of the Plum and
other stone fruits. The mature beetle lays the eggs in the
fruits when they are very small, usually beginning its work
about as soon as the flowers fall. These eggs soon hatch, and
the little maggot bores into the fruit. Those fruits which
are attacked whilst very young ordinarily fall from the tree,
but those which are attacked when they are half or more
grown may adhere to the tree, but are wormy and gummy at
the picking time. The mature beetles are sluggish in the
mornings, and are easily jarred from the trees. Taking advantage
of this fact, the fruit-grower may jar them into sheets;
or, in large orchards, into a large canvas hopper, which is
wheeled from tree to tree upon a wheelbarrow-like frame, and
under the apex of which is a tin can into which the insects
roll. There is a slit or opening in one side of the hopper,
which allows the tree to stand nearly in the middle of the
canvas. The operator then gives the tree two or three sharp
jars with a padded pole or mallet. The edges of the hopper
are then quickly shaken with the hands and the insects roll
down into the tin receptacle. In this receptacle there is
kerosene oil, or it may be emptied from time to time. Just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
how long this machine is to be run in the orchard will depend
entirely upon circumstances. It is advisable to use the
catcher soon after the blossoms fall, for the purpose of finding
out how abundant the insects are. If a few insects are
caught upon each tree, there is indication that there are
enough of the pests to make serious trouble. If after a few
days the insects seem to have disappeared, it will not be
necessary to continue the hunt. In some years, especially in
those succeeding a very heavy crop, it may be necessary to
run the curculio-catcher every morning for four or five
weeks; but, as a rule, it will not be necessary to use it
oftener than two or three times a week during that season;
and sometimes the season may be shortened by one-half.
The insects fall most readily when the weather is cool, and
it, therefore, is best to get through the whole orchard, if
possible, before noon. Upon cloudy days, however, the
insects may be caught all day. A smart man can attend to
300 to 400 full-bearing trees in six hours if the ground has
been well rolled or firmed, as it should be before the
bugging operation begins. But whether the operation is
troublesome or not, it is the price of Plums, and the grower
must not expect to succeed long without it. The same
treatment is essential to the saving of peaches and rarely,
also, of sour cherries.</p>

<p><b>Poppy.</b> These showy annuals and perennials
should be more generally grown. Nothing will lighten up
a corner better than the hardy oriental Poppy, or the
solid crimson or scarlet annual Poppies. All of the varieties
grow readily from seed, which, in most cases, should
be sown where the plants are to bloom. The seeds of the
oriental and the Iceland Poppy may be sown in pots, the
plants wintered over in a frame and carefully planted
out the second spring. The Poppy is very impatient of
root disturbance, however, and the safest method is to sow
the seed where wanted.</p>

<p><b>Portulaca</b>, or <span class="smcap">Rose Moss</span>. Brilliant little tender<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
annuals, low-growing and sun-loving. They usually
seed themselves, and once established will continue for
years. Many of the varieties will produce a good percentage
of flowers as double as roses and of many colors.
Seed should be sown where wanted. They bloom freely in
light, sandy soil in the full blaze of the sun.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/178-potatoes.jpg" width="110" height="233" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Potatoes</p>
</div>

<p><b>Potato.</b> The common practice of growing
Potatoes in ridges or elevated hills is wrong, unless the soil
is so wet that this practice is necessary to insure proper
drainage; but in this case the land is not adapted to the
growing of Potatoes. If the land is elevated into ridges or
hills, there is a great loss of moisture by means of evaporation.
During the last cultivating the Potatoes may be
hilled up slightly in order to cover the tubers; but the hills
should not be made in the beginning. Land for
Potatoes should be rather loamy in character, and
ought to have a liberal supply of potash, either
naturally or supplied in the drill, by means of an
application of sulfate of potash. See that the
land is deeply plowed or spaded, so that the roots
can penetrate deeper. Plant the Potatoes 3 or
4 inches below the natural surface of the ground.
It is ordinarily best to drop the pieces in drills.
A continuous drill may be made by means of dropping
one piece every 6 inches, but it is usually
thought best to drop two pieces about every 12
to 18 inches. The drills are far enough apart to allow good
cultivation. If horse cultivation is used, the drills should
be at least 3 feet apart.</p>

<p>Small Potatoes are considered not to be so good as large
ones for planting. One reason is because too many sprouts
arise from each one, and these sprouts are apt to crowd
each other. The same is true of the tip end or seed end of
the tuber. Even when it is cut off, the eyes are so numerous
that one secures many weak shoots rather than two or
three strong ones. It is ordinarily best to cut the Potatoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to two or three eyes, leaving as much tuber as possible
with each piece. From seven to eight bushels of Potatoes
are required to plant an acre.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 185px;">
<img src="images/179-potdeep.jpg" width="185" height="248" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Too deep</p>
</div>

<p>For a very early crop in the garden, tubers are sometimes
sprouted in the cellar. When the
sprouts are 4 to 6 inches high the tubers are
carefully planted. It is essential that the
sprouts are not broken in the handling.
In this practice, also, the tubers are first
cut into large pieces, so that they will not
dry out too much.</p>

<p>The staple remedy for the Potato bug is
Paris green, 1 pound of poison to 150 to 200
gallons of water, with a little lime (<a href="#paris_green">see
<i>Paris Green</i></a>). For the blight, spray with
Bordeaux mixture, and spray thoroughly.
Bordeaux mixture will also keep away the
flea beetle to a large extent.</p>

<p><b><a name="potting" id="potting"></a>Potting.</b> The operation of potting
a plant, while in itself simple, is very often
associated with success or failure in the
growth of the plant. The first and most
common reason of failure is using too large
a pot; the second, imperfect drainage;
and the third, the poor physical condition
of the soil.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 191px;">
<img src="images/180-potfull.jpg" width="191" height="304" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Too full</p>

<p class="caption">Careless</p>
</div>

<p>A small-rooted cutting or a feeble plant
should have a pot only large enough to
hold soil sufficient to surround the roots to
the extent of 1 or 2 inches. More soil
would hold too much moisture, thus excluding
the air. As the plants grow and
the ball of dirt becomes well covered with white roots,
and before these roots become dark in color, the plant
should be repotted, using a pot one size larger and usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a little richer soil. This operation should continue until
the plant has made the desired growth. If it is desired to
grow a geranium, fuchsia, begonia, or
plants of a similar character, large enough
for a window plant&mdash;say to the height or
breadth of two feet,&mdash;a 6-inch pot will be
large enough, provided the soil is rich
enough to continue the growth of the
plant while in flower. It often happens
that pots of the various sizes are not to
hand; and in case the pot is too large, it
should have the drainage increased until it
will take up as much room in the bottom as
the pot is too large. Bear in mind that
the soil should not hold free water. After
the plant has filled the pot with roots it
will often be necessary to supply more food
as the soil becomes exhausted. This may
be done by digging out the top soil down
to the young, white roots, replacing with
new soil in which a little rotted manure,
a pinch of bone-meal or other plant-food,
has been added. Liquid manure
may be used. This liquid manure is
made from well rotted cow-, horse-, or
sheep-manure thrown into a tub or barrel,
covered with water, and allowed to stand
until the strength of the manure is
soaked out. This liquid should be diluted
before using with clear water until it has
the color of weak coffee. If used with
judgment, nothing will cause a better
growth or a greater quantity of flowers.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 196px;">
<img src="images/181-potgood.jpg" width="196" height="288" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Good!</p>
</div>

<p>The drainage may consist of any coarse material, such
as old broken pots, small stones, pieces of charcoal, and the
like, over which should be placed small broken sod or a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
moss to keep the dirt from washing through and eventually
stopping up the crevices through which the excess water
should flow.</p>

<p>A safe rule to follow in first potting the majority of
house-plants, is to use one-third turf-loam, one-third leaf-mold
or decayed leaves, and one-third sand, thoroughly
mixed. Reduce the amount of leaf-mold and sand at
successive pottings, adding a little well
rotted manure, until, when the plants have
been potted in 6-inch pots, at least four-fifths
of the soil is turfy loam. Press the
soil firmly in the pot and around the plant.
Never fill the pot level full of soil, else the
plant cannot be watered.</p>

<p><b><a name="prickly" id="prickly"></a>Prickly Poppies</b>, or <span class="smcap">Argemones</span>,
are hardy annuals, with large, bluish
striking foliage and yellow flowers. They
are easily grown in a warm soil and sunny
exposure. Sow the seeds where the plants
are to stand. Thin to 12 to 18 inches
apart. They grow 2 feet high.</p>

<p><b>Primulas</b>, or <span class="smcap">Primroses</span>, are of
various kinds. One of them is the Auricula (<a href="#auricula">which see</a>).
Others are hardy border plants. The true or English cowslip
is one of these; also the plants commonly known as
Polyanthus. Hardy Primulas grow 6 to 10 inches high,
sending up trusses of yellow and red flowers in early
spring. Propagated by division, or by seed sown a year
before the plants are wanted. Give them rich, moist soil.</p>

<p>The Primula of the winter-garden is mostly the <i>P. Sinensis</i>
(Chinese Primrose), grown very extensively by florists as a
Christmas plant. With the exception of the full double
varieties, it is usually grown from seed. The seed sown in
March or April will make large flowering plants by November
or December, if the young plants are shifted to
larger pots as needed. The seed should be sown on the flat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
surface of the soil, composed of equal parts loam, leaf-mold
and sand. The seed should be pressed down lightly and
the soil watered carefully to prevent the seed from being
washed into the soil. Very fine sphagnum moss may be
sifted over the seed, or the box set in a moist place,
where the soil will remain wet until the seeds germinate.
When the plants are large enough they should be potted separately
or pricked out into shallow boxes. Frequent pottings
or transplantings should be given until September, when they
should be in the pots in which they are to bloom.
The two essentials to successful growth through
the hot summer are shade and moisture. Height
6 to 8 inches. Bloom in winter and spring.</p>

<p><b>Prunes</b> are varieties of plums with
firm, meaty flesh, and which readily make
dried fruit. Some of the Prunes are commercially
grown in the East, but they are
sold in the green state as other plums are;
and they are adapted to all the uses of
other plums. Prunes are cultivated like
other plums.</p>

<p><b><a name="pruning" id="pruning"></a>Pruning.</b> There are two general types of
inquiry connected with the question of Pruning:
First, that which has to do with the healing of the
wounds; and second, that which has to do with the
shaping of the top and the general welfare of the tree.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 242px;">

<p>When a limb is cut off, it heals by being covered
with callus tissue, which grows out from the cambium zone
between the bark and wood and rolls over the face of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
wound. The hard wood itself never heals; that is, the
cells do not have the power of making new cells; therefore
the old wood is simply covered up, or hermetically sealed as
a cap is put on a fruit jar. It is evident,
therefore, that no kind of dressing
will hasten the healing of this
wound. The merit of a dressing is to
keep the wound sound and healthy until
the callus naturally covers it over.
All things considered, the best dressing
is probably thick linseed-oil paint.</p>

<p class="caption">After pruning</p>
</div>

<p>So far as the wound is concerned,
the best time for Pruning is ordinarily
in the spring, when the vital activities
are beginning; but the season also influences
fruit-bearing and wood-making,
and these questions should be considered. Those wounds
heal best which are on strong main limbs, where there is
a full flow of nutritious sap. The limb should be cut off so
that the wound is parallel with the trunk upon which it sits,
and close to it. That is to say, the longer the stub, the less
rapid in general is the healing of the
wound. It is the custom to cut the
limb just outside the bulge at its base;
but, in most cases, it is better to cut
through this bulge, and to have the
wound close to the main trunk.</p>

<p>Heavy Pruning of the top tends to
the production of wood; therefore the
severe Pruning of orchard trees, following
three or four years of neglect,
sets the trees into heavy wood-bearing,
and makes them more vigorous.
Such treatment generally tends away
from fruit-bearing. This heavy Pruning is usually necessary
in neglected orchards, however, to bring trees back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
into shape and to revitalize them; but the best Pruning-treatment
of an orchard is to Prune it a little every year.
It should be so Pruned that the tops of the trees
will be open, that no two limbs will interfere
with each other, and so that the fruit itself will
not be so abundant as to overload the tree.
Pruning is a means of thinning. In general,
it is best to prune orchard trees late in winter
or early in spring. It is ordinarily better,
however, to leave peaches and other tender fruits until
after the buds have swollen, or even after the flowers
have fallen, in order that one may determine how much
they have been injured by the winter. Grapevines should
be Pruned in winter or not later (in New York) than the
first of March. If Pruned later than this, they may bleed.
The above remarks will apply to other trees as well as to
fruits.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that Pruning has two objects:
one is to merely trim the tree or to
make it assume some designed shape; the
other is to make the tree more vigorous or
more fruitful, or to make some other change
in its character. These ideals are well illustrated
in the Pruning of ornamental shrubs.
If one wants to have the shrubs sheared into
some particular shape, the shearing
may be done at almost any time of the
year; in fact, it is better to do it two
or three times each year in order to
keep the trees trim and neat. If,
however, the desire is to secure more
flowers, the case is a very different one. Some shrubs
and trees bear their flowers on the wood of the preceding
year. Such, for example, are the early flowering
shrubs like lilacs and the snowballs. The flower
buds are made the fall before. In this case, Pruning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the shrub in winter cuts off the flower buds. The ideal time
for Pruning them, therefore, is just after the flowers have
passed. The flower buds will form later in the season
for the production of the flowers the following spring.
Other shrubs, however (particularly those which
blossom late in the season), bear on wood of the
current year’s growth. That is, the clematis
blossoms in late summer and fall on wood
which grew that same season. The
greater the quantity of strong wood
which grows in any season, therefore,
the greater the quantity of bloom in that
season. With such shrubs, it is well to
Prune in winter or early spring, and to Prune
rather heavily. The abundance of new shoots
which arise may be expected to bear flowers later
on in the same season.</p>

<p>Following are some shrubs which, for best results
in flower-bearing, may be Pruned when dormant
(in winter): camellia, Jackmani type of clematis,
cornus, hibiscus (shrubby), hydrangea, many
loniceras or honeysuckles, philadelphus or mock-orange,
some spireas.</p>

<p>Shrubs which may be Pruned when in leaf (just after
blooming): lilac, deutzia, weigelas, exochorda, spring-flowering
loniceras, tree peony, flowering almond, some
spireas and viburnums, wistaria.</p>

pear and plum trees may be Pruned when received

unbroken wood.</p>

<p class="caption">Spring Radishes</p>
</div>

<p><a name="R" id="R"></a><b>Radishes</b> should be grown quickly in order to
have them at their best. They become tough and woody if
grown slowly or allowed to stay in the ground too
long. A light soil, well enriched, will grow most of
the early varieties to table size in from three to five
weeks. To have a supply through the early months,
sowings should be made every two weeks.
For summer, the large white or gray varieties
are best. The winter varieties may be
sown in September, harvested before severe
frosts, and stored in sand in a cool cellar.
When they are to be used, if thrown into cold
water for a short time they will regain their crispness.
Sow Radishes thickly in drills, 12 to 18 inches apart.
Thin as needed.</p>

<p><b>Raspberry.</b> Both the red and black Raspberries
are essentials of a good garden. A few plants of
each will produce a supply of berries for a family through
six or eight weeks, provided both early and late varieties
are planted. A cool situation, soil that will hold moisture
without being wet, and a thorough preparation of the
ground, are the conditions necessary to success. The black-cap
Raspberries should be set 3 to 4 feet apart, the rows 6<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
or 7 feet; the red varieties 3 feet apart, the rows 5 feet
apart. Spring setting is usually preferable.</p>

<p>As with blackberries and dewberries, Raspberries bear
on last year’s canes, and these canes bear but once.
Therefore cut out the old canes after fruiting, or before the
following spring, thus destroying such insects and fungi as
may have lodged on them. New canes should have grown
in the meantime, 3 to 6 to a hill.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 172px;">
<img src="images/187-raspberries.jpg" width="172" height="115" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Black Raspberries</p>
</div>

<p>The first year after the plants are set the canes should
be pinched back when they reach the height of from 30 to
36 inches. If a very vigorous growth has been made the
first season two canes may be left for fruiting, but in the
case of weak growth, only one cane should be allowed to
fruit. In case of low-growing varieties&mdash;those that have
been pinched back short&mdash;a mulch of straw or grass around
the plants at fruiting time will help to hold
the moisture, and also serve to keep the
fruits clean in case of heavy rains. A
Raspberry plantation will last three to five
years. The black varieties are propagated
by layers, the tip of a cane being laid in
the soil in midsummer; by fall the tip
will have taken root and may be separated. The red
varieties are propagated by suckers from the roots. In
nurseries both blacks and reds are often propagated by
means of root-cuttings.</p>

<p>For red rust, pull out the plant, root and branch, and
burn it. Short rotations&mdash;fruiting the plants only two or
three years&mdash;and burning the old canes and trimmings,
will do much to keep Raspberry plantations healthy. Spraying
will have some effect in combating anthracnose. Raspberries
may be bent over to the ground so that the snow
will protect them, in severe climates.</p>

<p>Varieties are always changing in favor. Good black-caps
are Gregg, Ohio, and Kansas. Good red and purple
sorts are Shaffer, Cuthbert, Loudon, and others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
<b>Rhododendrons</b> are broad-leaved evergreen
shrubs which require a fibrous or peaty soil and protection
from bleak winds and hot suns in winter. It is well to
plant them amongst trees for protection. In the North,
mulch heavily with leaves in the fall. See that the soil is
made fibrous with leaf-mold or other material. Rhododendrons
bloom from winter buds: therefore prune just after
flowering, if at all.</p>

<p><b>Rhubarb</b>, or <span class="smcap">Pie Plant</span>. This is usually propagated
by division of the fleshy roots, small pieces of which
will grow if separated from the old, established roots and
planted in rich, mellow soil. Poor soil should be made rich
by spading out at least 3 feet of the surface, filling with
well rotted manure to within 1 foot of the level, throwing in
the top soil and setting the roots with the crowns 4 inches
below the surface, firming them with the feet. The stalks
should not be cut for use until the second year, but the first,
as well as the succeeding falls, some coarse manure should
be thrown over the crowns, to be forked or spaded in lightly
when spring opens.</p>

<p>In growing seedling Rhubarb, the seed may be sown in a
coldframe in March or April, protected from freezing, and
in two months the plants will be ready to set in rows, 12
inches apart. Give the plants good cultivation, and the
following spring they may be set in a permanent place. At
this time the plants should be set in well prepared ground,
at a distance each way of from 4 to 5 feet, and treated as
those set with pieces of roots.</p>

<p>If given good care and well manured, the plants will live
for years and yield abundantly. Two dozen good roots will
supply a large family.</p>

<p><b><a name="roses" id="roses"></a>Roses.</b> It seems to be the first desire of the home
maker, when he considers the planting of his grounds, to
set out Roses. As a matter of fact, it should be one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the last things to do. Roses are essentially flower garden
subjects, rather than lawn subjects. That is to say, the
flowers are their chief beauty. They have very little to
commend them in the way of foliage or habit, and they are
inveterately attacked by insects and sometimes by fungi.
In order to get the best results with Roses, they should be
placed in a bed by themselves, where they can be tilled and
pruned and well taken care of; and they should be grown
as specimen plants, as other flower garden plants are. The
ordinary garden Roses should rarely be grown in mixed
borders of shrubbery.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 158px;">
<img src="images/189-roseswild.jpg" width="158" height="219" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Wild Roses</p>
</div>

<p>If it is desired to have Roses in mixed borders, then the
single and informal types should be chosen. The best of all
these is <i>Rosa rugosa</i>. This has not only attractive
flowers through the greater part of
the season, but it also has very interesting
foliage and a striking habit. The great profusion
of bristles and spines gives it an individual
and strong character. Even without the
flowers, it is valuable to add character and
cast to a foliage mass. The foliage is not attacked
by insects or fungi, but remains green
and glossy throughout the year. The fruit is
also very large and showy, and persists on
bushes well through the winter. Some of
the wild Roses are also very excellent for mixing into foliage
masses, but, as a rule, their foliage characteristics are rather
weak, and they are liable to be attacked by thrips.</p>

<p>Probably the most extensively grown class of Roses is
the Remontant or Hybrid Perpetual. These, while not
constant bloomers, are so easy of culture and give such
good returns for the care and labor, that their popularity
grows each year. The list of good varieties is very extensive,
and while a few, such as General Jacqueminot, Paul
Neyron, Marshall P. Wilder, Victor Verdier, Anne de Diesbach,
and Ulrich Brunner, are seen in most collections, one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
cannot go far wrong in planting any of the list. Two of the
Hybrid Chinese Roses may go with the Remontants, having
the same season of bloom and being about as hardy.
These are Magna Charta and Mme. Plantier.</p>

<p>The next group in point of hardiness, and superior to
the foregoing in continuity of bloom, are the Hybrid
Noisettes, such as Coquette des Alpes, Coquette des
Blanches, and Elise Boelle. The blooms of these are white,
often tinted with pink, very double and fragrant.</p>

<p>The Hybrid Tea section, containing Duchess of Albany,
La France, Meteor and Wootton, is very fine. These are
not hardy in the North, but if protected by a frame, or if
grown in pots, wintered in a pit, no class of Roses will give
more general satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Bourbon section contains three of the best bedding
Roses,&mdash;Apolline, Hermosa, and Souvenir de la Malmaison.
These will bloom continually through the fall
months until severe frost, and with a little protection will
prove hardy.</p>

<p>The Bengal Roses, of which Agrippina is a leading variety,
bloom through a long season, but are not hardy, and
should be protected in a pit. They also make very fine
pot-plants.</p>

<p>The Moss Roses are well known, and are desirable in a
general collection.</p>

<p>The little Polyantha Roses, with Cecile Brunner and
Clothilde Soupert as two of the best, are always attractive,
either when planted out or grown in pots.</p>

<p>The climbing Roses, which bloom later in the season
than the Remontants, are very useful as pillar and screen
plants. The old Queen of the Prairies and Baltimore Belle
are still in favor. A newer and better variety is the Crimson
Rambler.</p>

<p>The Tea Roses have proved more disappointing to the
amateur than any other. No one can resist the temptation
to try to have a few of these highly perfumed, richly colored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Roses, but unless one has a conservatory or an especially
favored location in the house, the results do not pay for the
trouble. A few blooms may be had outdoors with plants set
in the spring, but on the approach of winter they must be
taken up and protected by more secure means than is taken
with other Roses. If potted and grown in the house, they
are the first plants to become infested with red spider; or if
grown cool enough to escape that pest, they will be subject
to an attack of mildew. Still, the results are well worth
striving for, and a few persons will find the proper
conditions; but the Tea Rose is essentially a florist’s
flower.</p>

<p>All Roses are heavy feeders and require rich, moist
soil. A clay soil, if well enriched and having perfect
drainage, is ideal. Pruning should be carefully done,
preferably in the spring. All weak growth should be
cut out and the balance well cut back. The flowers
of all Roses, except the Yellow Persian and the
Harrison’s Yellow, being borne on the new wood, the bushes
should be cut back half or more of their growth.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, Roses on their own roots will
prove more satisfactory than budded stock. On own-rooted
stock, the suckers or shoots from below the surface of the
soil will be of the same kind, whereas with budded Roses
there is danger of the stock (usually Manetti or Dog Rose)
starting into growth and, not being discovered, outgrowing
the bud, taking possession, and finally killing out the weaker
growth. Still, if the plants are set deep enough to prevent
adventitious buds of the stock from starting, there is no
question that finer Roses may be grown than from plants
on their own roots.</p>

<p>The summer insects that trouble the Rose are best
treated by a forceful spray of clear water. This should be
done early in the day and again at evening. Those having
city water or good spray pumps will find this an easy
method of keeping Rose pests in check. Those without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
these facilities may use whale oil soap, fir-tree oil, good
soap suds, or Persian insect powder.</p>

<p><b>Roses in Winter.</b> Although the growing of
Roses under glass is a business which would better be left
to florists, as already said, the following advice may be
useful to those who have conservatories:</p>

<p>When growing forcing Roses for winter flowers, florists
usually provide raised beds, in the best-lighted houses
they have. The bottom of the bed or bench is left with
cracks between the boards for drainage; the cracks are
covered with inverted strips of sod, and the bench is then
covered with four or five inches of fresh, fibrous loam. This
is made from rotted sods, with decayed manure incorporated
at the rate of about one part in four. Sod from any
drained pasture-land makes good soil. The plants are set
on the bed in the spring or early summer, from 12 to 18
inches apart, and are grown there all summer.</p>

<p>During the winter they are kept at a temperature of 58°
to 60° at night, and from 5° to 10° warmer during the day.
The heating pipes are often run under the benches, not because
the Rose likes bottom heat, but to economize space
and to assist in drying out the beds in case of their becoming
too wet. The greatest care is required in watering,
in guarding the temperature and in ventilation. Draughts
result in checks to the growth and in mildewed foliage.</p>

<p>Dryness of the air, especially from fire heat, is followed
by the appearance of the minute red spider on the leaves.
The aphis, or green plant louse, appears under all conditions,
and must be kept down by syringing with tobacco-tea
or fumigation with tobacco stems.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 214px;">
<img src="images/193-rose.jpg" width="214" height="316" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A Hybrid Perpetual Rose</p>
</div>

<p>An effectual and preferable method now employed for
destroying the aphis is to fumigate with the vapor arising
from a pan containing a gallon of water and a pint of strong
extract of tobacco. To generate the vapor, a piece of red-hot
iron is dropped into the pan. From one to three or four
pans are required to a house, according to its size. For the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
red spider, the chief means of control is syringing with
either clear or soapy water. If the plants are intelligently
ventilated and given, at all times, as much fresh air as possible,
the red spider is less likely to appear. For mildew,
which is easily recognized by its white, powdery appearance
on the foliage, accompanied with more or less distortion
of the leaves, the remedy is sulfur
in some form or other. The flowers of
sulfur may be dusted thinly over the
foliage; enough merely to slightly whiten
the foliage is sufficient. It may be dusted
on from the hand in a broadcast way, or
applied with a powder-bellows, which is
a better and less wasteful method. Again,
a paint composed of sulfur and linseed oil
may be applied to a portion of one of the
steam or hot-water heating pipes. The
fumes arising from this are not agreeable
to breathe, but fatal to mildew. Again,
a little sulfur may be sprinkled here and
there on the cooler parts of the greenhouse
flue. Under no circumstances,
however, ignite any sulfur in a greenhouse. The vapor
of burning sulfur is death to plants.</p>

<p><i>Propagation.</i>&mdash;The writer has known women who could
root Roses with the greatest ease. They would simply
break off a branch of the Rose, insert it in the flower-bed,
cover it with a bell-jar, and in a few weeks they would have
a strong plant. Again they would resort to layering; in
which case a branch, notched half way through on the lower
side, was bent to the ground and pegged down so that
the notched portion was covered with a few inches of soil.
The layered spot was watered from time to time. After
three or four weeks roots were sent forth from the notch and
the branch or buds began to grow, when it was known that
the layer had formed roots.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Several years ago a friend took a cheese-box, filled it
with sharp sand to the brim, supported it in a tub of water
so that the lower half inch of the box was immersed. The
sand was packed down, sprinkled, and single-joint
Rose cuttings, with a bud and a leaf
near the top, were inserted almost their
whole length in the sand. This was in July,
a hot month, when it is usually difficult to
root any kind of cutting; moreover, the box
stood on a southern slope, facing the hot
sun, without a particle of shade. The
only attention given the box was to keep
the water high enough in the tub to touch
the bottom of the cheese-box. In about
three weeks he took out three or four dozen
of as nicely rooted cuttings as could have
been grown in the greenhouse.</p>

<p>The “saucer system,” in which cuttings are inserted in
wet sand contained in a saucer an inch or two deep, to
be exposed at all times to the full sunshine, is of a similar
nature. The essentials are, to give the cuttings the “full
sun” and to keep the sand saturated with water.</p>

<p>Whatever method is used, if cuttings are to be transplanted
after rooting, it is important to pot them off in
small pots as soon as they have a cluster of roots one-half
inch or an inch long. Leaving them too long in the sand
weakens the cutting.</p>

<p><b>San José Scale</b> has now become a wide-spread
pest. It has been introduced into the eastern
states from the Pacific slope. It is a minute scale
insect the size of a small pinhead, shield-shaped,
with a raised center. There are various native and
comparatively harmless scales which look very much like
it, and an expert is usually needed to distinguish them.
The San José Scale can usually be distinguished, however,
by its very serious results. In favorable seasons it spreads
with enormous rapidity, covering the branches of many
kinds of plants, sapping their juices, and either killing or
reducing them to such a low state of vitality as to render<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
them useless; or they are killed by the winter. The indications
are that the scale will never be so serious in the
moist, cool climates of the northeastern states as it is in
the hotter and drier climates of the West. It has been
found by careful experiments that it can be killed by a
spray of kerosene and water (<a href="#kerosene">see <i>Kerosene</i></a>) in a proportion
of one part of kerosene to four or five of water. This material
is applied with a mechanical pump mixer, and the application
should be made on a sunny day so that evaporation
soon takes place. Spraying with kerosene in cloudy weather
is very likely to result in injury to the plants. Some experimenters
have found crude petroleum to be a specific for
the San José Scale.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that the San José Scale can be
exterminated any more than the tent caterpillar or apple
scab can. It follows, therefore, that we should spray for
the San José Scale as we do for other pests. It is such a
serious pest, however, that the state or province should take
measures to hold it in check. Some system of inspection
should be inaugurated, and it is probably best that nursery
stock be fumigated with hydrocyanic gas before it is sold.
This gas is exceedingly poisonous, however, and should
never be handled by the inexperienced. Whenever it is
used, it should be under the control of experts. Plants or
plantations which are badly infested with the scale would
better be destroyed.</p>

<p><b>Scabiosa.</b> <span class="smcap">Mourning Bride.</span> A useful annual,
producing a profusion of bloom through the greater part of
the summer if not allowed to go to seed. The flowers range
in color from white to rich purple, are borne on long
stems, and are very lasting. The seed may be sown where
the plants are wanted, or to hasten the season of bloom may
be sown in boxes in February and grown along to be planted
out in April.</p>

<p><b>Scarlet Runner.</b> One of the pole or running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
beans (<i>Phaseolus multiflorus</i>). It is a great favorite with people
from the Old World, especially English and Germans. This
bean is used either as an ornamental vine for porches or
trellises, or as a screen to hide unsightly objects. The red
flowers are very showy, either on the plant or in bouquets.
The green pods are excellent as string beans, and the dried
beans are of superior quality. Seed should not be sown
until the ground has become thoroughly warm; or the plants
may be started in the house.</p>

<p><b><a name="scraping" id="scraping"></a>Scraping</b> of trees is rarely to be advised, except in
fruit plantations. The old and hanging bark on apple and
pear trees may be taken off in order to destroy the hiding
places of insects and the breeding places of fungi, and also
to make the plantation look more neat and kempt. Only
the loose outer bark should be removed, however. Trees
should not be scraped to the quick. If there is moss on
trees, it can be destroyed readily by a spray of Bordeaux
mixture.</p>

<p>A large part of the beauty of an ornamental tree lies in
its characteristic bark, and it is very rare that such trees
should be scraped.</p>

delicacy when blanched. The seed should be sown in a hotbed
early in the spring, plants transplanted to the garden
when from 2 to 3 inches high, and given high cultivation
through the season, being covered with litter on the approach
of winter. The young stalks are blanched early the following
spring by covering with large pots or boxes, or by banking
with sand or other clean material. The Dwarf Green Scotch,
Dwarf Brown, and Siberian are among the leading varieties.
Sea-kale is eaten much as asparagus is. Highly prized by
those who know it.</p>

<p>Sea-Kale is also propagated by cuttings of the roots 4 or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
5 inches long, planted directly in the soil in spring. The
plant is perennial, and the early shoots may be bleached
year after year.</p>

<p><b>Seed Sowing.</b> The general rule in sowing
seeds is to cover them twice or three times their thickness.
This rule will apply to the majority of seeds, but in many
plants of a naturally short season of bloom or growth, an
instance of which is the sweet pea, it may be advisable
to sow the seed deeper, that the roots may have sufficient
moisture and be in a cool temperature through the hot
summer months. Also, in sowing very minute seed, as
tobacco, petunia, begonia, and others of like size, care
should be taken to have them only under the surface of the
soil,&mdash;simply pressed down with a smooth surface or allowed
to settle into the soil with the soaking in of the water. The
soil for all seeds should be loose and porous, in order to
allow the excessive moisture to escape and the warmth to
penetrate, but should be firmed directly over the seeds to
induce an upward flow of moisture. One of the most common
mistakes in sowing seed is in sowing all kinds at the
same time without regard to the season, thus causing a failure
with some, while others grow freely. All tender seed
should be sown only when the ground has become thoroughly
warm, while seeds of the so-called hardy plants may be
sown as early in the spring as the ground is fit to work. A
few kinds of seed are the better for soaking, especially such
as for some reason have been delayed in sowing. Sweet pea
seed is benefited by soaking if not put into the ground until
the soil is warm. Seed of canna, moonflower and others
with hard shells may be scraped until the outer shell is
pierced or is very thin.</p>

<p>It is generally better to buy garden seeds than to grow
them, for those who make a business of seed-growing become
expert in the cultivation and selection of the plants.</p>

<p><b>Seeds</b> of most plants should be kept dry and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
also rather cool. It is always better to rely upon fresh
seeds. Test them in boxes in the house, if possible, before
planting them in the open. If beans, peas, corn or other
Seeds become buggy, pour a little bisulfide of carbon (very
inflammable) into them. The material will not injure the
Seeds even if poured on them. It soon evaporates. A teaspoonful
will kill the insects in four quarts of Seeds, if the
receptacle is tight.</p>

<p>Most tree Seeds should be kept moist until planted.
They are usually buried or kept in sand.</p>

<p><b>Sensitive Plant</b> (<i>Mimosa</i>). This curious plant
is often grown for the amusement it affords by its habit of
closing its leaves and dropping the leaf-stalk whenever the
plant is touched. Seed should be sown in heat early in the
season, and the plants grown in pots or a protected border.
The seed is sold by all seedsmen. The plant grows readily
in a temperature suited to beans. It will not stand frost.
The young plants are usually the most sensitive.</p>

<p><b><a name="trees" id="trees"></a>Shade Trees.</b> The best Shade Trees are
usually those which are native to the particular region,
since they are hardy and adapted to the soil and other conditions.
Elms, maples, basswoods, and the like, are nearly
always reliable. In regions in which there are serious
insect enemies or fungous diseases, the trees which are
most likely to be attacked may be omitted. For instance,
in parts of the East the elm leaf beetle is a very serious
pest; and it is a good plan in such places to plant other
trees than elms. Amongst the best exotic trees for shade
in the northern parts of the country are the Norway maple,
European lindens, horse chestnut, and the European species
of elm. Trees for shade should ordinarily be given sufficient
room that they may develop into full size and
symmetrical heads. The trees may be planted as close as
10 or 15 feet apart for temporary effect; but as soon as they
begin to crowd they should be thinned.</p>

<p><b><a name="shrub" id="shrub"></a>Shrubbery.</b> Shrubs have two kinds of values
or uses: first, they are useful for their own sakes or as
individual specimens; and second, for use in the making of
foliage masses or groups. Ordinarily they are used only for
the former purpose in home grounds; but their greatest use
is, nevertheless, in heavy masses about the borders of the
place or in the angles of the building. That is to say,
they should contribute to the general design of the place
or to its pictorial effect. If they are planted in Shrubberies
or masses, the flowers are still as interesting and
as showy as they are when the bushes are planted alone.
In fact, the flowers usually show to better advantage,
since they have a heavy background of foliage. In the
Shrubbery mass the bushes are more easily cared for than
when they are scattered as single specimens over the lawn.
The single specimen which is irregular, or ragged, or untidy,
is an undesirable object; but such a specimen may
contribute an indispensable part to the border mass. In the
border they do not need the attention to pruning that they
do in the lawn. The main part of the Shrubbery mass
should be made of the stronger, larger growing and coarser
Shrubs; and the more delicate ones, or those with highly
colored leaves or showy flowers, may be placed near the
inner edge of the plantation. Shrubs which are valued
chiefly for their flowers or showy foliage, as, for example,
the <i>Hydrangea paniculata</i>, may be planted just in front of a
bold Shrubbery mass, so that they will have a background
to show off their beauties. Further directions for the lay-out
of the grounds will be found under the articles <a href="#lawns"><i>Lawns</i></a>
and <a href="#border"><i>Borders</i></a>.</p>

<p>It is ordinarily best to plow or spade the entire area in
which the Shrubs are to be set. For a year or two the
ground should be tilled between the Shrubs, either by horse
tools or by hoes and rakes. If the place looks bare, seeds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
quick-growing flowers may be scattered about the edges of
the mass. The larger Shrubs, like lilacs and syringas, may
be set about 4 feet apart; but the smaller ones should be
set about, 2 feet apart if it is desired to secure an immediate
effect. If after a few years the mass becomes too crowded,
some of the specimens may be removed. Throw the Shrubs
into an irregular plantation, not in rows, and make the
inner edge of the mass more or less undulating and broken.
It is a good practice to mulch the plantation each fall with
light manure, leaf-mold or other material. Even though the
Shrubs are perfectly hardy, this mulch greatly improves the
land and promotes growth. After the Shrub borders have
become two or three years old, the drifting leaves of fall
will be caught therein and will be held as a mulch. It is
often advisable not to remove these leaves, but to allow
them to remain year after year, where they make a fine
covering of leaf-mold. When the Shrubs are first planted,
they are headed back one-half or more; but after they are
established they are not to be pruned, but allowed to take
their own way, and after a few years the outermost ones
will droop and meet the greensward.</p>

<p>Good Shrubs are numerous. Some of the best are those
to be found in woods and along roadsides. They are hardy.

<p><b>Silene</b>, or <span class="smcap">Catchfly</span>. Some of the Silenes are
hardy annuals of very easy culture. Sow seeds where the
plants are to stand; or, if early results are desired, seeds
may be started in boxes. The plants thrive in any garden
soil, even if it is not very rich. Colors red, or sometimes
running to white. One foot. Let plants stand 6 to 10
inches apart.</p>

<p><b>Smilax</b> of the florists is closely allied to
asparagus. While it cannot be recommended for house culture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the ease with which it may be grown and the uses to
which the festoons of leaves may be put, entitle it to a
place in the conservatory or greenhouse. Seed sown in pots
or boxes in January or February, the plants shifted as
needed until planted on the bench in August, will grow fine
strings of green by the holidays. The plants should be set
on low benches, giving as much room as possible overhead.
Green-colored strings should be used for the vines to climb
on, the vines frequently syringed to keep down the red
spider, which is very destructive to this plant, and liquid
manure given as the vines grow. The soil should contain a
good proportion of sand and be enriched with well-rotted
manure. After the first strings are cut, a second growth
fully as good as the first may be had by cleaning up the
plants and top-dressing the soil with rotted manure.
Slightly shading the house through August will add to the
color of the leaves. The odor from a vine of Smilax
thickly covered with the small flowers is very agreeable.</p>

<p><b><a name="snapdragon" id="snapdragon"></a>Snapdragon</b>, or <span class="smcap">Antirrhinum</span>. An old garden
favorite, flowering freely through a long season. The dwarf
strain is well adapted for bedding or borders. Any light
soil, well enriched with rotted manure, will grow Snapdragons
to perfection. Distinct varieties should be propagated
by cuttings, as they do not come true from seed.
Sow seed early in the spring.</p>

<p>Although bloom may be obtained the first year, late
sown plants sometimes persist over winter and bloom early
in the spring. Snapdragons make good window plants.</p>

<p><b><a name="snowdrop" id="snowdrop"></a>Snowdrop</b> (<i>Galanthus</i>). This is one of the
earliest flowers of spring, always welcome. It should be
planted in the edge of the border. The bulbs may be
planted in October in any good border soil and left undisturbed
for years; or they may be potted at that time, and
after forming roots be gently forced into bloom in winter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
<b>Sodding.</b> In general, the best way to secure a
lawn is by the sowing of seed (<a href="#lawns">see <i>Lawn</i></a>), since it is the
least expensive way. For small areas, and along the sides
of walks and drives, sods may be used. The results are
quicker. Unless the sod is of the right kind, however,
and very carefully laid, the results are not so good as
with seed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/204-cutter.jpg" width="49" height="169" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Sod-cutter,
for
trimming
sod edgings</p>
</div>

<p>The sod which is best adapted to the Sodding of lawns
is that which comes from an old, closely grazed pasture.
Sod from a sheep pasture is supposed to be best. Such
sod has been so closely grazed that it has made a very
dense mat of roots, and all the weeds have been destroyed.
The droppings of the animals also make the
ground rich. The sod should be cut in very thin strips.
It should not be more than an inch and one-half or two
inches in thickness. If it is thicker than that, it is heavy and
bulky to handle, and is not so easily laid. Ordinarily, the
sod is cut in strips ten inches or a foot wide. A board is
laid on the sod and the strip is cut along either side of it
with a sod cutter or a sharp spade. Two men then roll
up the sod. One stands on the strip of sod with his face
toward the man who, with the spade, cuts it loose beneath.
As it is cut loose, the man on the strip rolls the sod so that
the upper surface is on the inside of the roll. Strips longer
than ten or twelve feet make rolls which
are too heavy to handle with ease.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 186px;">
<img src="images/204-cutting.jpg" width="186" height="100" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Cutting sod</p>
</div>

<p>The soil upon which the sod is to be
placed should be very loose, so that the sod,
can be pounded down firmly. Some heavy
pounder should be used, as a block of wood.
It is usually impossible to pound down sod with the back of a
spade sufficiently firm unless the soil is very loose. The
sod should be pounded until the top is about level with the
surrounding soil. This insures contact with the soil beneath,
so that there are no air spaces and no likelihood of
drying out. Sod pounded down as firmly as this should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
grow very readily. If a sod edging is laid along walks and
drives, it should be pounded down an inch or more lower
than the surrounding loose land which is seeded, because
the loose land will finally settle; otherwise the sod border
is likely to be higher than adjacent land after a year or two.</p>

<p>If there are uneven places on the sodded area, these depressions
can be filled in with very loose, fine soil; and the
grass will grow through it. In dry weather, a sodded area
may be mulched with a half inch of fine loam to protect it.</p>

<p><b>Soils.</b> Soils are of many kinds. The classification
of soils depends upon one’s point of view. Gardeners
ordinarily call a good, friable, dark-colored, rich Soil a
garden loam. No Soil is so good that it cannot be improved.
It is improved in two general ways: by tilling (<a href="#tillage">see <i>Tillage</i></a>),
and by the application of various substances.</p>

<p>In considering the improvement of lands by the application
of foreign substances, two distinct things are to be considered:
the improvement of the physical texture, or tilth,
of the Soil; the increasing of its plant-food. These are
coördinate objects. In some cases one may be of prime
importance, and in another case the other may be more
necessary. Lands which have a fair store of available plant-food
may be unproductive. Such lands may be very greatly
benefited by stable manure, even though that manure may
have lost a large part of fertility by being baptized under
the eaves of the barn. If plant-food alone is needed, then
some concentrated or commercial fertilizer may be the best
thing to apply. In most cases the main or chief amelioration
of the land is to be wrought by tillage, stable manures,
mulches, green crops, and the like; if special results are
desired, commercial fertilizers may be added more or less
liberally, as the case demands (see <a href="#manure"><i>Manures</i></a>, <a href="#fertilizers"><i>Fertilizers</i></a>).</p>

<p>The top-dressing of Soils is often very beneficial because
it tends to prevent the escape of moisture, and often improves
the physical texture. If the material contains plant-food,
the land will also be directly enriched. The trimmings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
from lawns may be a distinct protection to lands if
allowed to remain (<a href="#lawns">see <i>Lawns</i></a>); and the leaves which blow
into clumps of shrubbery may often be allowed to remain
with good results. However, if the leaves become too thick
year after year, they tend to induce a surface rooting of the
shrubs. This, however, may be no disadvantage unless the
mulch were finally to be removed. One of the very best
top-dressings for borders and shrubbery is spent tan
bark, since it does not pile up on the ground, but
tends to work into it. Well-rotted sawdust often
has the same effect. These materials are much used
by gardeners, when they can be had, since they can
be raked into the soil in the spring, and need not be
removed.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Spades</b> and <b>Shovels</b> must be a part of every
garden equipment. The common and most useful forms
are shown in the cuts, but long-handled tools are more
useful for the loading of earth, the making of ditches, the
spreading of mulches, and the like. It
pays to buy the steel tools, with strongly
strapped handles.</p>

<p><b>Spearmint</b> is prized by many
people as a seasoning, particularly for
the Thanksgiving and holiday cookery.
It is a perennial and perfectly hardy,
and will live in the open garden year
after year. If a supply of the fresh
herbage is wanted in winter, remove
sods of it to the house six weeks
before wanted. Place the sods in
boxes, and treat as for house plants. The plants should
have been frosted and become perfectly dormant before
removal.</p>

<p><b>Spinach.</b> Probably the most extensively grown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
early spring vegetable, being in great demand as greens.
The earliest crop that finds its way to market is gathered
from seed sown in September or October, often protected
by frames or other means through the severe winter,
and cut soon after growth starts in early spring. Even as
far north as New York Spinach may stand over winter without
protection. Spinach is forced by placing sash over
the frames in February and March, protecting the young
leaves from severe freezing by mats or straw thrown over
the frames. Seed may be sown in early spring for a succession;
later in the season seed of the New Zealand Summer
Spinach may be sown, and this will grow through the heat
of the summer and yield a fine quality of leaves. The seed
of this kind being very hard, should be scalded and
allowed to soak a few hours before sowing. This seed is
usually sown in hills about three feet apart, sowing four to
six seeds in each hill. The spring and winter Spinach should
be sown in drills 12 to 14 inches apart, one ounce being sufficient
for 100 feet of drill. Remember that common
Spinach is a cool-weather (fall and spring) crop.</p>

<p><b><a name="spraying" id="spraying"></a>Spraying.</b> Of late years Spraying has come to
be one of the most important of all horticultural operations.
Most kinds of injurious fungi and insects can be combated
by a water spray in which various poisons or injurious substances
are contained. There are two general classes of
Spraying material: first, fungicides, or those which are
used for the control of fungi or plant diseases; second, insecticides,
or those which are used for the control of insect
enemies.</p>

<p>The fungicides usually contain copper or sulfur, or both.
The most popular and generally useful fungicide is the
Bordeaux mixture (<a href="#bordeaux">which see</a>). It should be borne in mind
that most injurious fungi work on the interior of the leaf or
stem, and only the spore-bearing parts come to the surface.
It is therefore very important that Spraying with fungicides
be done very early in order to prevent the fungus from getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a hold. It is much better to Spray once very thoroughly
than to Spray a half dozen times carelessly. It is
important that the entire surface of the foliage or stems be
covered with the material in order to prevent the access of
the fungi.</p>

<p>Of insecticides, there are two general types: those
which kill by external contact and are applied to plant lice,
scale insects, and all other insects which suck their food;
and the poisonous compounds which are used for the chewing
insects, as all the tribes of worms and beetles. Of the
former class, the most important material is kerosene in
various forms (<a href="#kerosene">which see</a>). Of the latter kind is Paris
green (<a href="#paris_green">which see</a>). For insects, Spray just as soon as the
attack is evident. Paris green and Bordeaux mixture may
be used together.</p>

<p>The best pump for Spraying is the one which throws the
stream the greatest distance with the least amount of liquid,
and the best nozzle is that which distributes the material
most finely and evenly. For Spraying plants close at hand,
the Vermorel nozzle is now the most popular. If it is desired
to reach the tops of large trees, some other nozzle
should be used, as the McGowen, Boss, or other types.
Every outfit should have two or three kinds of nozzles for
different kinds of work. Get a pump with much power.</p>

<p>Spray thoroughly. The general rule is to spray the entire
plant until the material begins to drip, at which time it may
be supposed that the plant is covered completely. When
and how often one should Spray, and what material he
should use, will depend entirely upon the difficulty which
he is endeavoring to combat. Most fruit trees should be
Sprayed before they bloom and again just afterwards. Sometimes
they will need Spraying again.</p>

growing winter Squashes in a northern climate, it is essential
that the plants start off quickly and vigorously:
a little chemical fertilizer will help.

and crocus, flowering at the same time,
but continuing longer in bloom. The colors
are red, pink, blue or white. The blue varieties have very
fine shades of color. Should be planted in October and
remain undisturbed.</p>

<p><b><a name="stocks" id="stocks"></a>Stocks.</b> The Ten-weeks and the biennial or
Brompton Stocks, are found in nearly all old-fashioned gardens.
Most gardens are thought to be incomplete without
Stocks, and the use of the biennial flowering species as house
plants is increasing. The Ten-weeks Stock is usually grown
from seed sown in hotbed or boxes in March. The seedlings
are transplanted several times previous to being planted out
in early May. At each transplanting the soil should be made
a little richer. The double flowers will be more numerous
when the soil is rich.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
The biennial species should be sown the season previous
to that in which flowers are wanted, the plants wintered over
in a cool house, and grown on the following spring.
They may be planted out through the summer and lifted into
pots in August or September for winter flowering. These
may be increased by cuttings taken from the side shoots; but
the sowing of seed is a surer method, and unless an
extra fine variety is to be saved, it would be the best one to
pursue. Height 10 to 15 inches.</p>

<p><b>Storing.</b> The principles which are involved in
the Storing of perishable products, as fruits and vegetables,
differ with the different commodities. All the root crops,
and most fruits, need to be kept in a cool, moist and uniform
temperature if they are to be preserved a great length of
time. Squashes, sweet potatoes, and some other things, need
to be kept in an intermediate and what might be called a
high temperature; and the atmosphere should be drier than
for most other products. The low temperature has the effect of
arresting decomposition and the work of fungi and bacteria.
The moist atmosphere has the effect of preventing too great
evaporation and the consequent shriveling. In the Storing
of any commodity, it is very important to see that the product
is in proper condition for keeping. Discard all specimens
which are bruised or which are likely to decay. Much of the
decay of fruits and vegetables in Storage is not the fault of
the Storage, but is really the work of diseases with which the
materials are infested before they are put into Storage. For
example, if potatoes and cabbages are affected with the rot,
it is practically impossible to keep them any length of
time.</p>

<p>Apples, winter pears, and all roots, should be kept at a
temperature somewhat near the freezing point. It should not
raise above 40° Fahr. for best results. Apples can even be
kept at one or two degrees below the freezing point if the
temperature is kept uniform. Cellars in which there are
heaters are likely to be too dry and the temperature too high.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
In such cases it is well to keep fresh vegetables and fruits in
tight receptacles, and pack the roots in sand or moss in order
to prevent shriveling. In these places, apples usually keep
better if headed up in barrels than if kept on racks or
shelves. In moist and cool cellars, however, it is preferable
for the home supply to place them on shelves, not piling
them more than five or six inches deep, for then they can be
sorted over as occasion requires.
In case of fruits, be
sure that the specimens are
not over-ripe when placed in
storage. If apples are allowed
to lie in the sun for a few days
without being packed, they
will ripen so much that it is
very difficult to keep them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/211-cellar.jpg" width="305" height="165" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A good out-door cellar</p>
</div>

<p>Cabbages should be kept at a low and uniform temperature,
and water should be drained away from them.
They are Stored in many ways in the field, but success depends
so much upon the season, particular variety, ripeness,
and the freedom from injuries by fungi and insects,
that uniform results are rarely secured by any method. The
best results are to be expected when they can be kept in a
house which is built for the purpose, in which the temperature
can be kept uniform and the air fairly moist. When
Stored out of doors, they are likely to freeze and thaw alternately;
and if the water runs into the heads, mischief is
likely to result. Sometimes they are easily Stored by being
piled into a conical heap on well-drained soil and covered
with dry straw, and the straw covered with boards. It does
not matter if they are frosted, provided they do not thaw out
frequently. Sometimes cabbages are laid head down in a
shallow furrow plowed in well-drained land, and over them
is thrown straw, the stumps being allowed to project through
the cover. It is only in winters of rather uniform temperature
that good results are to be expected from such methods.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
In the Storing of all things, especially those which have
soft and green matter, as cabbages, it is well to provide
for the heating of the produce. If the things are buried out
of doors, it is important to put on a very light cover at first
so that the heat may escape. Cover them gradually as the
cold weather comes on. This is important with all vegetables
that are placed in pits, as potatoes, beets and the like. If
covered deeply at once, they are likely to heat and rot.
All pits made out of doors should be on well-drained and
preferably sandy land.</p>

<p>When vegetables are wanted at intervals during the
winter from pits, it is well to make compartment pits,
each compartment holding a wagon load or whatever
quantity will be likely to be wanted at each time. These
pits are sunk in well-drained land, and between each
of the two pits is left a wall of earth about a foot thick.
One pit can then be emptied in cold weather without interfering
with the others.</p>

<p>An outside cellar is better than a house cellar in which
there is a heater, but it is not so handy. If it is near the
house, it need not be inconvenient, however. A house is
usually healthier if the cellar is not used for storage. House
cellars used for storage should have a ventilating shaft.</p>

<p class="caption">Strawberries</p>
</div>

<p><b>Strawberry.</b> The saying that Strawberries will
grow on almost any soil is misleading, although true.
Some varieties of Strawberries will grow
on certain soils better than other varieties.
What these varieties are can only
be determined by an actual test, but it is
a safe rule to select such varieties as
prove good in many localities. As to
the methods of culture, so much depends
on the size of the plot, the purpose for
which the fruit is wanted, and the amount of care one is
willing to give, that no set rule can be given for a garden
in which but few plants are grown and extra care can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
given. Large fruits and a number of them may be had by
growing to the single plant, keeping off all runners and
relying on numerous fruit-crowns on one plant for the
crop of berries. Or Strawberries may be grown by the narrow
matted-row system, in which the
runners, before rooting, should be
turned along the rows at a distance of
from 4 to 6 inches from the parent
plant. These runners should be the
first ones made by the plant and should
not be allowed to root themselves, but
“set in.” This is not a difficult operation;
and if the runners are separated
from the parent plant as soon as they
become well established, the drain on
that plant is not great. All other runners
should be cut off as they start. The row should be
about 12 inches wide at fruiting time. Each plant should
have sufficient feeding ground, full sunlight, and a firm
hold in the soil. This matted-row system is perhaps as
good a method, either in a private garden or field culture,
as could be practiced. With a little care in hoeing, weeding
and cutting off runners, the beds
seem to produce as large crops the
second year as the first.</p>

<p class="caption">Well planted Strawberry</p>
</div>

<p>The old way of growing a crop
was to set the plants 10 to 12 inches
apart, in rows 3 feet apart, and allow
them to run and root at will,
the results being a mass of small,
crowded plants, each striving to obtain
plant-food and none of them succeeding in getting
enough. The last, or outside runners, having but the
tips of their roots in the ground, are moved by the
wind, heaved by the frost, or have the exposed roots
dried out by the wind and sun.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Ground rich in potash produces the firmest and best
flavored berries. Excessive use of stable manure, usually
rich in nitrogen, should be avoided, as tending to make too
rank growth of foliage and berries of a soft texture.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 248px;">

<p class="caption">Pot-grown Strawberry</p>
</div>

<p>Except in the case of a skillful grower in a favored
locality, the fall setting of plants is not to be recommended.
The preparation of the soil and care of the
plants more than overbalance the partial crop obtained the
following spring.</p>

<p>In the single-plant or hill system the plants should be set
12 inches apart, in rows 3 feet apart. In the narrow matted
row system the plants should be set 18 inches apart, in rows
3½ feet apart. The first method requires about 14,000
plants per acre, the second about 8,000 plants.</p>

<p>The winter treatment of a Strawberry bed should consist
in covering the plants, when the ground is frozen, in November
or December, with straw or hay. Salt marsh hay, if obtainable,
is the best, as no weed seeds are introduced. Cover
the soil and the plants to the depth of 3 to 6 inches. As
soon as growth begins in spring, rake the mulch off, allowing
it to lie between the rows; or, if the soil is hard or
weedy, it may be taken off the patch entirely, the ground
tilled, and then replaced for the purpose of holding moisture
and keeping the berries clean.</p>

<p>Usually, Strawberries may be fruited twice or three
times; but on rich soil, with extra good care, the first
crop may be very heavy, and the patch may be plowed
up thereafter. Some varieties do not produce pollen, and
not more than two rows of these should be planted without
a row of a pollen-bearing kind.</p>

<p>The rust and mildew may be held in check by Bordeaux
mixture. It is usually sufficient to spray after the blooming
season (or at any time the first year the plants are set),
in order to secure healthy foliage for the next year.</p>

<p><b><a name="sweet_herbs" id="sweet_herbs"></a>Sweet Herbs.</b> The Herb garden should find a
place on all amateurs’ grounds. Herbs may readily be made
profitable by disposing of the surplus to the green grocer
and the druggist. The latter will often buy all that the
housewife wishes to dispose of, as the general supply of
medicinal herbs is grown by specialists, and goes into the
hands of the wholesaler and is often old when received
by the local dealer. The seedsmen’s catalogues mention
upwards of forty different Herbs, medicinal and culinary.
The majority of them are perennial, and will grow for many
years if well taken care of. However, it is better to resow
every three or four years. The annual kinds are raised
from seeds each year. Beds 4 feet square of each of the
Herbs will supply an ordinary family.</p>

<img src="images/217-swpea.jpg" width="130" height="240" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Sweet Pea</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="sweet_pea" id="sweet_pea"></a>Sweet Pea.</b> No annual receives greater attention
these days than the Sweet Pea. Sweet Pea exhibitions
are held in several sections of the country, the press gives
considerable space to the discussion of varieties, and the
public generally is interested in the growing or buying of
the flower. On any occasion the Sweet Pea is in place. A
bouquet of shaded colors, with a few sprays of galium or the
perennial gypsophila, makes one of the choicest of table
decorations. Deep, mellow soil, early planting and heavy
mulching suit them admirably. Sow the seeds as soon
as the ground is fit to work in the spring, making a drill 5
inches deep. Sow thickly and cover with 2 inches of soil.
When the plants have made 2 or 3 inches growth above the
soil, fill the drill nearly full, leaving a slight depression in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
which water may be caught. After the soil is thoroughly
soaked with water, a good mulch will hold the moisture. To
have the ground ready in early spring, it is a good plan to
trench the soil in the fall. The top of the soil then dries out
very quickly in the spring and is left in good physical condition.
Frequent syringing with clear water will
keep off the red spider that often destroys the
foliage, and attention to picking the seed pods
will lengthen the season of bloom. If the finest
flowers are wanted, do not let the plants stand
less than 8-12 inches apart.</p>

<p>A succession of sowings may be made at intervals
through May and June, and a fair fall crop
obtained if care is taken to water and mulch;
but the best results will be secured with the very
early planting. In the middle and southern states,
the seed may be planted in fall, particularly in
lighter soils. It is easy to get soils too rich in nitrogen for
Sweet Peas; in such case, they will run to vine at the expense
of flowers. If the plants are watered, apply enough
to soak the soil, and do not water frequently.</p>

<p><b><a name="sweet_potato" id="sweet_potato"></a>Sweet Potatoes</b> are grown from sprouts
planted on ridges or hills, not by planting the tubers, as
with the common or Irish potato. The method of obtaining
these sprouts is as follows: In April, tubers of Sweet
Potatoes are planted in a partially spent hotbed by using the
whole tuber (or if a large one, by cutting it in two through
the long way), covering the tubers with 2 inches of light,
well firmed soil. The sash should be put on the frames and
only enough ventilation given to keep the Potatoes from decaying.
In ten or twelve days the young sprouts should
begin to appear, and the bed should be watered if dry. The
sprouts when pulled from the tuber will be found to have
rootlets at the lower end and along the stems. These
sprouts should be about 3 to 5 inches long by the time
the ground is warm enough to plant them out. The ridges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
or hills should be prepared by plowing out a furrow 4 to 6
inches deep. Scatter manure in the furrow and plow back
the soil so as to raise the center at least 6 inches above the
level of the soil. On this ridge the plants are set, placing
the plants well in to the leaves, and about 12 to 18 inches
apart in the rows, the rows being from 3 to 4 feet apart.
The after cultivation consists in stirring the soil between the
ridges; and as the vines begin to run they should be
lifted frequently to prevent rooting at the joints. When the
tips of the vines have been touched by frost the crop may be
harvested, the tubers left to dry a few days, and stored in a
dry, warm place. To keep Sweet Potatoes, store in layers
in barrels or boxes in dry sand, and keep them in a dry
room. See that all bruised or chilled potatoes are thrown out.</p>

<p><b><a name="syringing" id="syringing"></a>Syringing</b> plants with water has two general
offices: to clean the plants of pests or of dirt; to check
evaporation or transpiration from the plant itself.</p>

<p>Gardeners look upon water as a good insecticide. That
is, if it can be thrown upon the plants somewhat forcibly by
means of a syringe or pump, or by the hydrant hose, it will
wash off the insects and drown many of them. The water
should be applied in a fine and somewhat forcible spray.
Care should be taken that the plant is not torn or bruised.
The red spider is one of the most serious pests on house
plants, and, in a dry season, on plants about the lawn.
It thrives in a dry atmosphere. It usually lives on the
under sides of the leaves. Syringing the plants frequently
will destroy the pests. The thrips and slugs on rose bushes
can nearly always be kept in check if one can spray or
syringe his plants frequently. <a href="#spraying">See <i>Spraying</i>.</a></p>

<p>Syringing to check transpiration from the foliage is
very useful with plants which are recently transplanted.
For instance, when carnations are taken from the field and
placed in the house, it is well to syringe them occasionally
until they have become established. The same is true with
cuttings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
In Syringing plants, it is well to take care that the
ground does not become too wet; otherwise the plant may
suffer at its root. In the house, plants should rarely be
syringed except when the weather is bright, so that they
may soon dry off. The plant should not go into the night
with wet foliage. Out of doors in hot weather, it is best to
syringe toward nightfall. The foliage will ordinarily not
suffer in such cases. With plants in the house, it is necessary
to keep the leaves dry most of the time in order that
fungi may not breed. This is true of carnations, which are
very liable to attacks of the rust.</p>

<p>Plants are sometimes syringed or sprayed to protect them
from frost. <a href="#frost">See <i>Frost</i>.</a></p>

<p><a name="T" id="T"></a><b>Terraces</b> may be desirable for two reasons:
to hold a very steep slope; to afford an architectural base
for a building.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 262px;">
<img src="images/219-slope.jpg" width="262" height="134" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A slope is better than a terrace</p>
</div>

<p>It is rarely necessary to make a distinct Terrace in the
lawn. Even if the lawn is very steep, it may be better to
make a gradual slope than to cut the place in two with a
Terrace. A Terrace makes a place look smaller. It is always
difficult to make and to keep
in repair. The surface is not readily
cut with a lawn mower. Unless
the sod is very dense, the upper
corner tends to wash off with the
rains and the foot tends to fill in.
Nature does not have straight banks
unless they are rock. The illustration
in the margin shows how it is possible to treat a
sloping lawn. In the distance is a distinct, sharp-angled
Terrace; but in the foreground this Terrace has been
carried out into the lawn, so that the slope is an agreeable
one.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to Terrace a yard in order to hold it,
the Terrace would better be at one side rather than in the
middle. In that case, one is able to secure a good breadth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of lawn. If the Terrace is at the outer side next the street,
a perpendicular, mason-work, retaining wall may be constructed.
If it is on the inner side of the lawn, it may be
placed close to the building and be made to appear as a
part of the architecture: it may be made the base of the
building. If this is done, there should be a balustrade
around the edge of the Terrace to give it architectural feeling.
The descent from the Terrace to the lawn may be
made by means of steps, so as to add to the architectural
aspect of the place. Terraces are most in place about buildings
which have many strong horizontal lines; they do not
lend themselves so well to buildings in the Gothic style.
The general tendency is to make too many Terraces. The
cases are relatively few in which they may not be dispensed
with.</p>

<p><b>Thinning</b> of fruit has four general uses: to
cause the remaining fruit to grow larger; to increase the
chances of annual crops; to save the vitality of the tree;
to enable one to combat insects and diseases by destroying
the injured fruit.</p>

<p>The Thinning of fruit is nearly always done soon after
the fruit is thoroughly set. It is then possible to determine
which of the fruits are likely to persist. Peaches are usually
Thinned when they are the size of one’s thumb. If
Thinned before this time, they are so small that it is difficult
to pick them off; and it is not so easy to see the work of
the curculio and thereby to select the injured fruits. Similar
remarks will apply to other fruits. The general tendency
is, even with those who Thin their fruits, not to Thin
enough. It is usually safer to take off what would seem to
be too many than not to take off enough. The remaining
specimens are better. Varieties which tend to overbear
profit very greatly by Thinning. This is notably the case
with many Japanese plums, which, if not Thinned, are very
inferior.</p>

<p>Thinning may also be accomplished by pruning. If one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
knows where the fruit buds are, cutting them off will have
the effect of removing the fruit. In the case of tender
fruits, like peaches, however, it may not be advisable to
Thin very heavily by means of pruning, since the fruit may
be still further Thinned by the remaining days of winter,
by late spring frost, or by the leaf-curl or other disease.
However, the proper pruning of a peach tree in winter is,
in part, a Thinning of the fruit. The peach is borne on the
wood of the previous season’s growth. The best fruits are
to be expected on the strongest and heaviest growth. It is
the practice of peach-growers to remove all the weak and
immature wood from the inside of the tree. This has the
effect of Thinning out the inferior fruit and allowing the energy
of the tree to be expended on the remainder. Apples
are rarely Thinned; but in many cases, Thinning can be
done with profit. On all home grounds, fruits should be
Thinned whenever the trees are very full. In general, the
best time to thin the fruit, as already said, is when the
fruits have become large enough to be seen and handled.
The discarded fruits should be burned if they contain insects
or fungi.</p>

<p><b><a name="tillage" id="tillage"></a>Tillage.</b> By Tillage is meant the stirring
of the soil. Tillage is the fundamental operation
in agricultural practice. Most farmers till
for three reasons: to get the seed into the land; to keep
the weeds down; and to get the crop out of the land. The
real reason for Tillage, however, is to ameliorate the land;
that is, Tillage makes the soil mellow and fine, and an
agreeable place in which plants may grow. It enables the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
soil to hold moisture, to present the greatest feeding surface
to roots, to allow the circulation of air, and intensifies many
chemical activities. Tilling the soil is the first means of
making it productive. If one understands the many forces
that are set at work, the Tilling of the soil becomes one of
the most interesting and exciting of all agricultural operations.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 196px;">
<img src="images/222-tiller.jpg" width="196" height="216" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">For hand Tilling</p>
</div>

<p>The exact method of Tilling the soil in any particular
case must be determined by many circumstances. Light
soils are handled differently from heavy soils; and much depends
also upon the season of the year in which the Tillage
is done. In all ordinary soils, the effort should be made to
work them deep, so that there is a deep reservoir for the
storage of moisture and a large area in which roots can
work. Subsequent Tillage throughout the growing season
is performed very largely for the purpose of keeping the top
of the soil loose and fine so that the moisture from beneath
cannot pass off into the atmosphere. This loose layer of
soil, extending two or three inches from the surface, may
itself be very dry; but it breaks up the capillary connection
between the lower soil and the air, and thereby prevents
evaporation. This surface layer of loose, mellow soil is often
spoken of as the earth-mulch. It answers
much the same purpose as a mulch of
straw or leaves in interposing a material
between the moist soil and the air through
which the moisture cannot rise. If this
mulch is repaired as often as it should be,
weeds cannot grow; but the object of the
Tilling is more to make and maintain the
mulch than to destroy weeds. The surface
should be Tilled shallow in the growing season
as often as it tends to become compact
or encrusted. This will be after every rain, and usually as
often as once in ten days when there is no rain. The tools
to be used for this surface Tillage are those which will comminute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
or fine the soil most completely without compacting
it or leaving it in ridges or in furrows. In garden work, a
fine rake is the ideal thing; whereas in field work, some
of the wire-tooth weeders or smoothing harrows are excellent.
In fields which are hard and lumpy, however,
it will be necessary to use heavier and rougher tools.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 66px;">
<img src="images/223-rake.jpg" width="66" height="174" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Steel rake</p>
</div>

<p>In order to break down hard clay soils, one must exercise
great care not to work them when they are wet;
and also not to work them very much when they are dry.
There is a time, shortly after a rain, when clay lumps
will break to pieces with a very slight blow. At this
time it is well to go over them with a harrow or a
rake. After the next rain, they can be gone over again,
and before the end of the season the soil should be in fine
condition. An excellent way of breaking down clay land is
to plow or spade it in the fall and allow it to weather in
the winter. In such cases the land should not be raked or
harrowed, but allowed to lie rough and loose. Very hard
clay lands sometimes run together or cement if handled in
this way, but this will not occur if the land has stubble or
sod or a dressing of manure, for the fibrous matter will then
prevent it from puddling. Lime sown on clay land at the
rate of twenty to forty bushels to the acre also has a distinct
effect in pulverizing it. This may be sown in fall,
or preferably in spring when the land is plowed.</p>

<p>One of the most important ways of ameliorating land is
to work vegetable matter into it so as to give it humus.
Soils which are loose, black and friable contain much of
this vegetable mold. In many cases the chief value of
stable manure is to add this humus to the soil. Many soils
need humus more than they need plant-food, and hence
stable manure gives better results in those cases than commercial
fertilizers. The farmer secures the humus by plowing
under stubble and sod, and occasional green crops.</p>

shallow boxes placed in windows. A pinch of seed sown in
March will give all the early plants a large family can use.
When the plants have reached the height of two or three
inches they should be transplanted into 3-inch flower pots,
old berry boxes or other receptacles, and allowed to
grow slow and stocky until time to set them out, which is
from May 15 on (in New York). They should be set in rows
four or five feet apart, the plants being the same distance in
the rows. Some support should be given to keep the fruits
off the ground and to hasten the ripening. A trellis of
chicken-wire makes an excellent support, as does the light
lath fencing that may be bought or made at home. Stout
stakes, with wire strung the length of the
rows, afford an excellent support. A very
showy method is that of a frame made like
an inverted V, which allows the fruits to
hang free; with a little attention to trimming,
the light reaches the fruits and ripens
them perfectly. This support is made by
leaning together two lath frames. The late
fruits may be picked green and ripened on
a shelf in the sun; or they will ripen if placed in a drawer.</p>

<p>One ounce of seed will be enough for from twelve to
fifteen hundred plants. A little fertilizer in the hill will
start the plants off quickly. The rot is less serious when
the vines are kept off the ground and the rampant suckers
are cut out.</p>

<p><b>Tools</b> of many kinds, and well chosen, are
one of the joys of a garden. There is great satisfaction in
a well-made, clean tool which does its work well. Keep
the tools bright. They should be under cover, and in place,
when not in use. A cupboard may be built by the rear
porch, or in the barn or carriage house. See that the cupboard
is in a dry place. Various Tools have been mentioned
in the preceding pages, and other useful kinds are

<b>Transplanting.</b> This operation the gardener
calls in one instance “pricking out.” This means taking
young seedling plants from the seed box as soon as they are
large enough to be handled&mdash;usually when the first “rough”
leaves have developed&mdash;and replanting them in other boxes
or pots, either singly or at a greater distance apart than they
were when in the seed boxes. The term is used in the
operation of setting out plants from the hotbed, frame or
house to the garden; also in removing shrubs or trees.
Transplant on a cloudy day, and just before a rain, if
possible.</p>

<p><b>Trimming</b> is a term which is ordinarily confounded
with pruning (<a href="#pruning">which see</a>). The word “Trimming,”
however, should be restricted to the shaping of the trees and
not to the thinning of the tree or to pruning for wood, fruit
or other special object. Trimming is only one of the means
of pruning. Trimming is mostly used in the case of hedges.
It is also used to keep evergreens in shape. Many ornamental
plants are also Trimmed into various forms, although
it is a question if such Trimming is usually wise. Fruit
trees should be pruned, as a rule, rather than Trimmed:
that is, they usually should be allowed to take their natural
form, the pruner taking out the superfluous wood and keeping
them within manageable bounds.</p>

<p><b>Tropæolum.</b> <a href="#nasturtiums">See <i>Nasturtium</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Tuberose.</b> The Tuberose requires more heat
to grow to perfection than it is usually possible to give
here in the North. If planted in the border they will not
start into growth until the ground has become thoroughly
warm&mdash;usually after the middle of June,&mdash;making the season
before frost too short for their perfect growth and flower.
However, if started in loose soil or moss in a warm room or
on benches of a greenhouse, the roots will soon start from
the tuber and make a fine growth. If planted out in June
with a good ball of roots they are likely to bloom before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
frost. If any danger of frost is feared they may be lifted
into pots or boxes and taken into the house, when they will
bloom without a check. As with other bulbs, a sandy soil
will suit.</p>

<p><b>Tuberous Begonia.</b> A large bed of these covered
with crimson, pink, white, or yellow flowers, ranging from
2 to 4 and even 6 inches in diameter, some double, some
single, is a striking sight. Yet such a sight is not uncommon
about the large eastern cities where the Tuberous Begonia
is now used somewhat for bedding.</p>

<p>Our interior summers are more trying, and so far, few in
the west have succeeded so well with the Tuberous Begonia
as a bedding plant. It makes a fine summer-blooming pot-plant,
however, for the greenhouse or window, and with due
attention to its requirements, it may be used as a bedding
plant. It properly falls under greenhouse plants in its requirements.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 180px;">

<p class="caption">Double Tuberous Begonia</p>
</div>

<p>C. L. Allen, writing of its culture in his work on “Bulbs
and Tuberous-Rooted Plants,” says: “The principal point
learned in regard to its culture is, that it must be treated as
a plant and not as a bulb. The enthusiastic florist, seeing
the many good qualities of the plant, has
led amateurs to believe it could be treated
as a bulb, and planted out in the same manner
as the gladiolus or tigridia and kept
dormant during the winter in the same
manner. This is a great mistake, as the
tubers will not endure as long a period of
rest and cannot be exposed to the air for a
long time without seriously injuring their
vitality. The tubers must be kept in dry
earth or sand, until they show signs of growth, which will
be not later than the first of March; then they may be
started into rapid growth. After the eyes are fully developed
the tubers may be divided: each eye will make a plant.
Then they are treated in all respects like greenhouse plants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and grown on until the proper season for their planting out.
This is not before the first of June, as Begonias are quite
sensitive to cold nights, but not at all to heat. At that
time the plants should be fully 6 inches in height and proportionately
strong. Such plants will make a grand display
the entire season, rather delighting in great heat.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 179px;">
<img src="images/227-tuberbeg2.jpg" width="179" height="172" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Tuberous Begonia, single.</p>
</div>

<p>In starting the tubers in March, they should be placed
in moist sand or moss in a temperature of 60° to 65°, either
in the greenhouse or window. After the buds
are well started the tubers may be divided
as pointed out, or planted whole. They
prefer a rich, rather sandy soil. When
they are well under way give them all the
light and air they will bear, and keep
them close to the glass to avoid “legginess”
and to insure a firm, sturdy growth. A week
before planting them out they should be
given abundance of air and light to “harden off” the plants
preparatory to setting them in sun and wind.</p>

<p>The beds should be in a somewhat sheltered place where
they will be partially shaded from the hot midday sun.
Let the soil be well enriched with old manure or humus and
thoroughly worked over to a depth of one foot. During dry
periods the beds will need watering from time to time; but
never water them when the sun is shining full on them, or
the foliage may be scorched. A mulch of leaf-mold or old
manure will be helpful in keeping the soil moist and the
roots cool.</p>

<p>Before frost the tubers should be carefully taken up and
gradually dried in the shade, after which they are to be
placed in dry sand or earth, in shallow boxes, and kept till
time to start them in the spring. They should be kept
in a cool place, secure from frost and away from stoves or
heating pipes.</p>

<p>For amateurs it is better to recommend buying bulbs of
the several colors, instead of attempting to grow them from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
seeds, which are extremely small and require early sowing,
warmth and close attention.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 103px;">
<img src="images/228-tulip.jpg" width="103" height="169" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Tulip as a pot-plant</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="tulips" id="tulips"></a>Tulips</b> are hardy and easy to grow. The advice
given under <a href="#bulbs"><i>Bulbs</i></a>, <a href="#crocus"><i>Crocus</i></a> and <a href="#hyacinths"><i>Hyacinth</i></a> applies to
Tulips. They may be forced for winter bloom (<a href="#window-gardens">see
under <i>Window-Gardens</i></a>). The garden bed will last
several years if well cared for, but most satisfactory
bloom is secured if the old bulbs are taken up every
two or three years and replanted, all the inferior ones
being cast aside. When the stock begins to run
out, buy anew. Plant in October, 4 to 6 inches
deep.</p>

<p><b>Turnips</b> and <b>Rutabagas</b> are usually a fall
crop, from seed sown in July and early August,
although many kitchen gardens have them from spring
sown seed. The culture is easy. Sow in drills 12 inches
apart. They will become edible in from six to eight weeks.
They are cool-weather crops, and the tops stand much
frost. If maggots bother, do not raise them on the same
land again for three or four years. Bordeaux mixture
repels the flea-beetles. One ounce will sow 150 feet of
drill.</p>

<p><a name="V" id="V"></a><b>Varieties.</b> It is usually one of the first desires
of the intending planter to inquire about Varieties. It is
one of the secondary things to be considered, however, for
the first thing to do is to prepare the land, to determine
whether one’s soil and site are adapted to the plant in question,
and to discuss other matters of a general nature.
When all the fundamental things are settled, then the
question of Varieties, which is a special matter, may be
taken up. Although the selection of Varieties is a very
special matter, it is nevertheless essential to success or
satisfaction in the growing of any plant.</p>

<p>It should first be considered that the selection of Varieties
is very largely a personal matter. The man should grow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the Varieties which he likes. This is especially true in the
selection of Varieties for the home grounds, in which case
the market ideals enter very little into the problem. Having
satisfied one’s own mind as to what kinds of Varieties he
would like, he may then inquire of the neighbors and of experts
if those Varieties are adapted to the soil and climate.
If he intends to grow for market, he should canvass the
market demands thoroughly before choosing the Varieties.
The lists of Varieties in books, bulletins, and seedmen’s
catalogues are hints, not rules. As a general statement, it
may be said that the only way to determine the best variety
for one’s own conditions is to experiment. There is intense
satisfaction in the experimenting itself. The best lists of
Varieties are those which are recommended for some specific
purpose, and which represent the combined opinions of many
expert growers. It is rare that one man’s judgment should
be final, particularly with respect to fruits or plants which
are grown in general outdoor conditions. Under glass a
gardener can make his climate and conditions, and therefore
he can adapt his conditions to his plants. The experiment
station test usually represents but one man’s opinion.
It may be a more valuable opinion than that of another man,
but it is not final. It should be studied in connection with
other lists, particularly those made by practical growers. If
one desires to choose Varieties, therefore, he should consult
the best growers of those plants in his immediate neighborhood;
he should call upon the experiment station of his
state or province; and he should consult the most recent
writings on the subject.</p>

<p><b>Vegetable Garden.</b> It is one of the choicest
of pleasures to raise one’s own vegetables. Make the Vegetable
Garden ample, but economize labor. Plant the things
in rows, not in beds. Then they can be tilled easily, either
by horse- or hand-tools. Wheel-hoes will accomplish most
of the labor of tillage in a small garden. Have the rows
long, to avoid waste of time in turning and to economize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the land. One row can be devoted to one vegetable; or two
or more vegetables of like requirements (as parsnips and
salsify) may comprise a row. Have the permanent vegetables,
as rhubarb and asparagus, at one side, where they will
not interfere with the plowing or tilling. The annual vegetables
should be grown on different parts of the area in succeeding
years, thus practicing something like a rotation of
crops. If radish or cabbage maggots or club-root become
thoroughly established in the plantation, omit for a year or
more the vegetables on which they live.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 258px;">
<img src="images/230-layout.jpg" width="258" height="81" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">Lay-out of a farm Vegetable Garden</p>
</div>

<p>Make the soil deep, mellow and rich before the seeds are
sown. Time and labor will be saved. Rake the surface frequently
to keep down weeds and to prevent the soil from
baking (<a href="#tillage">see <i>Tillage</i></a>). Radish seeds sown with celery or
other slow-germinating seeds will
come up quickly, breaking the
crust and marking the rows. About
the borders of the Vegetable Garden
is a good place for flowers
to be grown for the decoration
of the house and to give to friends. Along one side of
the area rows of bush fruits may be planted.</p>

<p>A home Vegetable Garden for a family of six would require,
exclusive of potatoes, a space not over 100 by 150
feet. Beginning at one side of the garden and running the
rows the short way (having each row 100 feet long) sowings
may be made, as soon as the ground is in condition to work,
of the following:</p>

<p>Fifty feet each of parsnips and salsify.</p>

<p>One hundred feet of onions, 25 feet of which may be
potato or set onions, the balance black-seed for summer and
fall use.</p>

<p>Fifty feet of early beets, 50 feet of lettuce, with which
radish may be sown to break the soil and be harvested before
the lettuce needs the room.</p>

<p>One hundred feet of early cabbage, the plants for which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
should be from a frame or purchased. Set the plants 18
inches to 2 feet apart.</p>

<p>One hundred feet of early cauliflower; culture same as
for cabbage.</p>

<p>Four hundred and fifty feet of peas, sown as follows:</p>

<table class="planting" cellpadding="1" summary="Pea planting by type">
<tr><td align="right">100</td> <td>feet of extra early.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">100</td> <td>feet of intermediate.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">100</td> <td>feet of extra early, sown late.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">50</td> <td>feet of dwarf varieties.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If trellis or brush is to be avoided, frequent sowings of
the dwarfs will maintain a supply.</p>

<p>After the soil has become warm and all danger of frost
has passed, the tender vegetables may be planted, as
follows:</p>

<p>Corn in five rows 3 feet apart, three rows to be early and
intermediate, and two rows late.</p>

<p>One hundred feet of string beans, early to late varieties.</p>

<p>Vines as follows:</p>

<table class="planting" cellpadding="1" summary="Vine planting by type">

<tr><td align="right">10</td> <td>hills of Hubbard, 6 x 6 feet.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>One hundred feet of okra.</p>

<p>Twenty eggplants. One hundred ft. (25 plants) tomatoes.</p>

<p>Six large clumps of rhubarb.</p>

<p>An asparagus bed 25 feet long and 3 feet wide.</p>

<p>Late cabbage, cauliflower and celery are to occupy the
space made vacant by removing early crops of early and intermediate
peas and string beans.</p>

<p>A border on one side or end will hold all herbs, such as
parsley, thyme, sage, hyssop, mints.</p>

<p class="caption">Verbena</p>
</div>

<p><b>Verbena.</b> The Verbena is one of the most
satisfactory garden plants, blooming early. Bloom continues
through the dry, hot days of summer. As the cool weather
of the fall comes on, Verbenas increase in size of plant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and flower until killed by severe frost. Plants grown from
seed sown in a hotbed or house early in the spring, transplanted
into pots or boxes when large enough, and planted
out as soon as the ground has become warm, are more vigorous
and seem to have more fragrance than those grown from
cuttings. Many of the strains have become so well fixed
that the colors come true from seed. Cuttings
are often employed, but the handling
of stock plants is a difficult matter except
in the hands of a professional, and when
plants are wanted in quantity it is cheaper
to buy them of the plantsman than to
grow them from seed or attempt to keep
over stock plants. Therefore, for the home garden, seed-grown
plants are usually most satisfactory. Give a sunny
position. Thin to 10 to 15 inches apart each way.</p>

<p><b>Vinca</b>, or <span class="smcap">Periwinkle</span>. Trailing plants. Useful
in covering unsightly places, for vases, urns or baskets.
Some of the species (as the common evergreen, mat-like
“running myrtle”) are hardy, but the most useful ones need
the protection of a house through the winter. The variegated-leaved
kinds are fine for winter decorations. Propagated
mostly by cuttings. Perennials.</p>

<p><b><a name="vines" id="vines"></a>Vines.</b> The use of Vines for screens and
pillar decorations has increased in the last decade until now
they may be seen in nearly all grounds. The tendency has
been towards using the hardy Vines, of which the ampelopsis,
or Virginia creeper, is one of the most common. It is
a very rapid grower, and lends itself to training more readily
than many others. The Japan ampelopsis (<i>A. tricuspidata</i>
or <i>Veitchii</i>) is a fine clinging Vine, growing very rapidly
when once established, and being brilliantly colored after
the first fall frosts. It clings closer than the other, but is
not so hardy. Either of these may be grown from cuttings
or division of the plants. Two woody twiners of recent
introduction are the actinidia and the akebia, both from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Japan. They are perfectly hardy, and are rapid growers.
The former has large, thick, glossy leaves, not affected by
insects or disease, growing thickly along the stem and
branches, making a perfect thatch of leaves.
It blooms in June. The flowers, which are
white with a purple center, are borne in clusters,
followed by round or longish edible fruits.
The akebia has very neat cut foliage, quaint
purple flowers, and often bears ornamental
fruit. Other hardy Vines are the wistaria,
clematis, tecoma (or trumpet-flower), aristolochia
(or Dutchman’s pipe), hedera (or ivy),
and loniceras (or honeysuckles).</p>

<p>Of the tender Vines, the nasturtiums and
ipomœas are the most common, while the
adlumia (<a href="#adlumia">p. 3</a>), balloon vine (<a href="#balloon">p. 28</a>), passion
vine, and the gourds (<a href="#gourds">p. 115</a>), are frequently
used. One of the best of recent introduction
is the annual hop, especially the variegated
variety. This is a very rapid growing Vine, seeding itself
each year, and needing little care. <a href="#hop">See <i>Hop</i>.</a> All the
tender Vines should be planted after all danger of frost
is over.</p>

<p class="caption">Violets</p>
</div>

<p><b>Violet.</b> While the culture of Violets as house-plants
rarely proves successful, there is no reason why a
good supply may not be had elsewhere through the greater
part of the winter and the spring months. A sheltered location
being selected, young plants from runners
may be set in August or September. Have the
ground rich and well drained. These plants will
make fine crowns by December, and often will
bloom before weather sufficiently cold to freeze
them. In order to have flowers through the
winter, it will be necessary to afford some protection
to the plants. This may best be done
by building a frame of boards large enough to
cover the plants, making the frame in the same
way as for a hotbed, four to six inches higher
at the back than the front. Cover the frame
with sash or boards, and as the weather becomes
severe, mats or straw should be placed over
and around the frame to protect the plants from
freezing. Whenever the weather will permit,
the covering should be removed and air admitted,
but no harm will come if the frames are not disturbed
for several weeks. A large amount of sunlight and
a high temperature through the middle of winter are to
be avoided, for if the plants are stimulated a shorter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
period of bloom will result. In April the frame may
be removed, the plants yielding the later part of the crop
without protection. Violets belong with the “cool” plants
of florists. When well hardened off, considerable frost does
not harm them. They should always be kept stocky. Start a
new lot from runner-plants each year. They thrive in a
temperature of 55° to 65°.</p>

<p><a name="W" id="W"></a><b>Walks.</b> The place for a Walk is where it is
needed. It should go directly between two points. It need
not be straight, but if it is curved, the curve should be
direct. That is, the pedestrian should be conscious that he
is going in the direction in which he desires to go, and is
not making a detour for the simple purpose of following the
walk. Convenience should be the first thing to be considered.
After the Walks have been laid in the most convenient
places, the question of ornamenting the borders may
be considered. It is always well to avoid, so far as possible,
the bisecting of lawns by Walks, as that makes two lawns
where there should be only one. The larger a greensward
can be made to look, the more park-like and natural is the
place. Avoid taking the Walks circuitously around the
borders unless they are laid for the simple purpose of making
a ramble to show off the grounds. All Walks which are
designed for serious use should appear to be necessary,
direct and convenient.</p>

<p>Some soils which contain considerable loam and sand will
pack with tramping and will make good Walks, but it is
usually necessary to lay some material on the soil. Gravel,
cinders, and the like, may be better than the natural surface;
but in many cases they are worse, since the surface
is loose and is unpleasant to walk on. In Walks which
are on decided slopes, and down which the water is likely to
run, any loose material is very objectionable, since it runs to
the low places. The best material for Walks, all things
considered, is cement, or what is called artificial stone. If
well made, it is as durable as flagging, and is not so likely to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
get out of place. It holds its surface perfectly year
after year.</p>

<p>The only objection to cement Walks is when they are
more or less temporary, for in such cases they cannot be
moved. There is often very serious difficulty in securing
good cement Walks, but the difficulties are easily overcome.
They are chiefly two: there is not sufficient draining material
beneath the cement; and the cement itself is not made
strong enough. There should be at least a foot of loose
material, as brickbats or cinders, below the cement cover;
and if the place is low and likely to hold water, there should
be still greater drainage. Pound the material down, or let it
stand for some time until it becomes thoroughly settled
together. Then lay the cement in two courses. The first
course may be three or four inches thick and made of well
mixed mortar, comprising three parts Portland cement,
one part water lime, and two to three times as much sharp
sand as Portland. When this has become partially hardened,
but before it is set and while still moist, put on a
finishing layer of one inch, made of one part Portland
cement, one part water lime, and one part sharp sand. It is
important that the materials be very thoroughly mixed. See
that the edges of the walk are made square and true by laying
down a form of boards lengthwise the area before the
cement is put on. The edges should be as thick as the
middle, for a thin crust on the edge tends to snap off. A
walk made in this way on a well-drained foundation will last
almost indefinitely. It is best that it be made in such season
that it can become thoroughly set before frosty weather
comes.</p>

<p><b>Wallflower.</b> A favorite plant for pots or garden,
having a clove-like fragrance. Seed of most varieties
should be sown the year before wanted. One kind, being an
annual, will flower the same season the seed is sown. Hardy.
Two to 3 feet.</p>

<p><b>Washing</b> orchard trees is an old practice. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
usually results in making a tree more vigorous. One reason
is that it destroys insects and fungi which lodge underneath
the bark; but probably the chief reason is that it softens the
bark and allows the trunk to expand. It is possible, also,
that the potash from the soap or lye eventually passes into
the ground and affords some plant-food. Trees are ordinarily
Washed with soap suds or with a lye solution. The
material is usually applied with an old broom or a stiff
brush. The scrubbing of the tree is perhaps nearly or quite
as beneficial as the application of the wash itself.</p>

<p>It is customary to wash trees late in spring or early in
summer, and again in the fall, with the idea that such Washing
destroys the eggs and the young of borers. It no doubt
will destroy borers if they are just getting a start, but it will
not keep away the insects which lay the eggs, and will not
destroy the borers which have found their way underneath
the bark. It is perhaps quite as well to wash the trees very
early in the spring, when they are starting into growth. It
is an old practice to wash trees with strong lye when they
are affected with the oyster-shell bark louse. The modern
method of treating these pests, however, is to spray with
some kerosene compound when the young growth is starting,
for at that time the young insects are migrating to the new
wood and they are very easily destroyed.</p>

<p><b><a name="watering" id="watering"></a>Watering House Plants.</b> It is impossible to
give rules for the Watering of plants. Conditions that hold
with one grower are different from those of another. Advice
must be general. Give one good Watering at the time of
potting, after which no water should be given until the plants
really need it. If, on tapping the pot, it gives out a clear
ring, it is an indication that water is needed. In the case of
a soft-wooded plant, just before the leaves begin to show
signs of wilt, is the time for Watering. When plants are
taken up from the ground, or when plants have their roots
cut back in repotting, gardeners rely, after the first copious
Watering, on syringing the tops of the plants two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
times each day, until a new root-growth has started, Watering
at the roots only when absolutely necessary. Plants that
have been potted into larger pots will grow without the extra
attention of syringing, but those from the borders, that have
had their roots mutilated or shortened, should be placed in a
cool, shady spot and be syringed often. One
soon becomes familiar with the wants of individual
plants, and can judge closely as to need
of water. All soft-wooded plants with a large
leaf-surface need more water than hard-wooded
plants, and a plant in luxuriant growth of any
kind more than a plant that has been cut back
or become defoliated. When plants are grown in living-rooms,
moisture must be supplied from some source, and if
no arrangement has been made for having a moist air the
plants should be syringed often. <a href="#syringing">See <i>Syringing</i>.</a></p>

<p><b>Watermelon.</b> The culture of this is essentially
the same as that for muskmelons (<a href="#melon">which see</a>), except
that most varieties require a warmer place and longer period
of growth. Give the hills a distance of from 6 to 10 feet
apart. Choose a warm, “quick” soil and sunny exposure.
It is essential, in the North, that the plants grow rapidly and
come into bloom early. One ounce of seed will plant
thirty hills.</p>

<p><b>Wax Plant.</b> The Wax Plant, or <span class="smcap">Hoya</span>, is
one of the commonest of window-garden plants, and yet it
is one which people usually have difficulty in flowering.
However, it is one of the easiest plants to manage if a person
understands its nature. It is naturally a summer-blooming
plant, and should rest during the winter time. In the
winter, keep it just alive in a cool and rather dry place. If
the temperature does not go above 50° Fahr., so much
the better; neither should it go much lower. In late winter
or spring, the plant is brought out to warm temperature,
given water and started into growth. The old flower-stems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
should not be cut off, since new flowers come from them as
well as from the new wood. When it is brought out to be
started into growth, it may be repotted, sometimes into a
size larger pot, but always with more or less fresh earth.
The plant should increase in value each year. In
conservatories, it is sometimes planted out in the
ground and allowed to run over a wall, in which
case it will reach a height of many feet.</p>

<p><b><a name="weeds" id="weeds"></a>Weeds.</b> Many very strong Weeds
are a compliment to one’s soil: only good soil
produces them. But they are not a compliment
to one’s tillage. If the soil is well prepared
and well tilled to conserve moisture and
to unlock plant-food (<a href="#tillage">see <i>Tillage</i></a>), Weeds will
find little chance of growing. Stir the ground
often: it benefits the ground and keeps out
the Weeds. Plant vegetables in long straight
rows rather than in beds, for thereby tillage is
made easier. For beds and for small plants,
the hand-weeders (as shown in the margin) are very efficient.
They save laborious finger-work. Weed seeds are
often distributed in manure, especially if Weeds have been
allowed to grow and ripen on the piles. See
that pernicious Weeds do not seed about the
premises. For the treatment of weedy lawns,
see the article <a href="#lawns"><i>Lawns</i></a>.</p>

<p><b><a name="windbreaks" id="windbreaks"></a>Windbreaks.</b> There is the greatest
difference of opinion as to the value of Windbreaks
for fruit plantations. These differences
arise from the fact that a Windbreak
may be of great benefit in one place, but a disadvantage
in another. It is always advisable to break the force of
very strong winds, for such winds tend to injure the trees
when laden with fruit or ice, and they blow off the fruit;
and in dry countries they cause the soil to become parched.
If the wind is usually warmer than the area, however, particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in the winter time, it is better not to stop it, but to
allow it to circulate through the plantation. This is the case
in areas which lie close to large bodies of water. The wind
coming off the water is warmer than that off the land, and
tends thereby to protect the fruit plantation from severe cold.
A circulation of air is desirable in late spring and early fall
in order to avoid the still frosts. Therefore, if the area is
very closely surrounded by dense plantations, it may have
what the fruit-growers call “stagnant air;” but thinning out
the Windbreak on one or two sides, or cutting holes through
it, may allow the air to move through, thereby affording atmospheric
drainage and insuring greater immunity from
the light local frosts.</p>

<p>It is ordinarily better to break the force of the winds than
to stop or deflect them. That is, the Windbreak may be thin
enough to allow the wind to take its normal direction, but its
force is broken. A stone wall or a very dense hedge of
evergreens may cause the wind to rise over the plantation or
to be deflected to one side; and this, in many cases, as already
said, may be a decided disadvantage. The philosophy of
a good Windbreak for fruit plantations may be summed up in
this way: the force of heavy winds should be broken;
warm winds should be allowed to circulate freely through
the plantation; still air should be avoided.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, one or two rows of deciduous trees are sufficient
protection. When the plantation is very much exposed
to very cold or land winds, a thick evergreen screen
may be a decided advantage. It is usually better to have
the heavy Windbreak on the upper side of the area, so that it
may not interfere with the natural drainage of the cold air
down the slope. In making a Windbreak, it is important
that those trees be chosen which will not become harboring
places for orchard enemies. The wild cherry, for example,
is inveterately attacked by the tent caterpillar, and the wild
crabs and wild plums are likely to breed orchard insects. If
the Windbreak is planted some time in advance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
orchard, the row of fruit trees next the Windbreak will be
very likely to suffer from lack of moisture and food.</p>

<p>A different type of Windbreak is that which is desired for
a shelter belt about the home grounds. The matter of atmospheric
drainage does not enter into this problem to any
great extent. Such shelter belt is usually placed at the extreme
edge of the home yard, toward the heaviest or prevailing
wind. It may be a dense plantation of evergreens.
If so, the Norway spruce is one of the best for general purposes.
For a lower belt, the arborvitæ is excellent. Some
of the pines, as the Scotch or Austrian, are also to be advised,
particularly if the belt is at some distance from the
residence. As a rule, the coarser the tree the farther it
should be placed from the house.</p>

<p>Persons may desire to use the Windbreak as a screen to
hide undesirable objects. If these objects are of a permanent
character, as a barn or an unkempt property, evergreen
trees should be used. For temporary screens, any of the
very large-growing herbaceous plants may be used. Very
excellent subjects are sunflowers, the large-growing nicotianas,
castor beans, large varieties of Indian corn, and
plants of like growth. Very efficient summer screens may
be made with ailanthus, paulownia, basswood, sumac, and
other plants which tend to throw up succulent shoots from
the base. After these plants have been set a year or two,
they are cut back nearly to the ground every winter or
spring, and strong shoots are thrown up with great luxuriance
during the summer, giving a dense screen and presenting
a semi-tropical effect. For such purposes, the roots
should be planted only two or three feet apart. If, after a
time, the roots become so crowded that the shoots are weak,
some of the plants may be removed. Top-dressing the area
every fall with manure will tend to make the ground rich
enough to afford a very heavy summer growth.</p>

<p><b><a name="window-gardens" id="window-gardens"></a>Window-Gardens.</b>
<i>The Summer Window<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> Garden</i>.&mdash;This
type of gardening is particularly suited to
those who live in the crowded city, where the want of other
space makes the Window-Garden the only one possible.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 158px;">
<img src="images/242-window.jpg" width="158" height="236" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A summer window ledge</p>
</div>

<p>Handsomely finished boxes, ornamental tiling, and
bracket work of wood and iron suitable for fitting out windows
for the growing of plants, are on the market; but such,
while desirable, are by no means necessary. A stout pine
box of a length corresponding to the width of
the window, about 10 inches wide and 6 deep,
answers quite as well as a finer box, since it
will likely be some distance above the street,
and its sides, moreover, are soon covered by the
vines. A zinc tray of a size to fit into the
wooden box may be ordered of the tinsmith.
It will tend to keep the soil from drying out so
rapidly, but it is not a necessity. A few small
holes in the bottom of the box will provide
for drainage; but with carefulness in watering
these are not necessary, since the box by
its exposed position will dry out readily during summer
weather, unless the position is a shaded one. In the
latter case provision for good drainage is always advisable.</p>

<p>Since there is more or less cramping of roots, it will
be necessary to make the soil richer than would be required
were the plants to grow in the garden. The most desirable
soil is one that does not pack hard like clay, nor contract
much when dry, but remains porous and springy. Such a
soil is found in the potting soil used by florists, and it may
be obtained from them at from 50 cts. to $1 a barrel. Often
the nature of the soil will be such as to make it desirable
to have at hand a barrel of sharp sand for mixing with the
soil, to make it more porous and prevent baking.</p>

<p>Some pot the plants and then set them in the window-box,
filling the spaces between the pots with moist moss.
Again, they are planted directly in the soil. The former
method, as a general rule, is to be preferred in the winter
Window-Garden; the latter during the summer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
The plants most valuable for the purpose are those of
drooping habit, such as lobelias, tropæolums, <i>Othonna
crassifolia</i>, Kenilworth ivy, and sweet alyssum. Such
plants may occupy the front row, while back of them may be
the erect-growing plants, like geraniums, heliotropes,
begonias, etc.</p>

<p>Just what plants will be most suitable will depend on
the exposure. For the shady side of the street, the more
delicate kinds of plants may be used. For full exposure to
the sun, it will be necessary to select the more vigorous-growing
kinds. In the latter position, suitable plants for
drooping would be: *tropæolums, *passifloras, the single
petunias, sweet alyssum, lobelias, verbenas, mesembryanthemums.
For erect-growing plants: geraniums, heliotropes,
etc. If the position is a shaded one, the drooping
plants might be of the following: tradescantia, Kenilworth
ivy, *senecio or parlor ivy, sedums, *moneywort, vinca,
*smilax, *lygodium or climbing fern. Erect-growing
plants would be dracænas, palms, ferns, coleus, centaurea,
spotted calla, and others.</p>

<p>For shady situations the main dependence is upon plants
of graceful form or handsome foliage; while for the sunny
window the selection may be of blooming plants. Of the
plants above mentioned for these two positions, those
marked with an asterisk (*) are of climbing habit, and may
be trained up about the sides of the window. Others will be
found among the climbing plants mentioned under <a href="#vines"><i>Vines</i></a>,
<a href="#annuals"><i>Annuals</i></a> and <a href="#basket_plants"><i>Basket Plants</i></a>.</p>

<p>After the plants have filled the earth with roots, it will be
desirable to give the surface of the soil among the plants a
very light sprinkling of bone-dust or a thicker coating of
rotted manure from time to time during the summer; or instead
of this, a watering with weak liquid manure about
once a week. This is not necessary, however, until the
growth shows that the roots have about exhausted the soil.</p>

<p>In the fall the box may be placed on the inside of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
window. In this case it will be desirable to thin out the
foliage somewhat, shorten in some of the vines, and perhaps
remove some of the plants. It will also be desirable to
give a fresh coating of rich soil. Increased care will be
necessary, also, in watering, since the plants will have less
light than previously, and, moreover, there may be no provision
for drainage.</p>

<p><i>The Winter Window-Garden</i> may consist simply of a jardiniere,
or a few choice pot-plants on a stand at the window,
or of a considerable collection, with more or less elaborate
arrangements for their accommodation in the way of box,
brackets, shelves and stands. Expensive arrangements
are by no means necessary, nor is a large collection. The
plants and flowers themselves are the main consideration,
and a small collection well cared for is better than a large
one unless it can be easily accommodated and kept in
good condition.</p>

<p>The window for plants should have a southern, south-eastern
or eastern exposure. Plants need all the light they
can get in the winter, especially those which are expected
to bloom. The window should be tight-fitting.
Shutters and a curtain will be an advantage in cold
weather.</p>

<p>Plants like a certain uniformity in conditions. It is very
trying on them, and often fatal to success, to have them snug
and warm one night and shivering in a temperature only
a few degrees above freezing the next. Some plants will
live in spite of it, but they cannot be expected to prosper.
Those whose rooms are heated with steam, hot water or hot
air will have to guard against keeping rooms too warm
fully as much as keeping them too cool. Rooms in brick
dwellings that have been warm all day, if shut up and made
snug in the evening will often keep warm over night without
heat except in the coldest weather. Rooms in frame
dwellings, and exposed on all sides, soon cool down.</p>

<p>It is difficult to grow plants in rooms lighted by gas, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the burning gas vitiates the atmosphere. Most living-rooms
have too dry air for plants. In such cases the bow window
may be set off from the room by glass doors; one then has a
miniature conservatory.</p>

<p>While keeping the plants at a suitable temperature, we
must not forget that plants love moisture, or a humid atmosphere,
and that our living-rooms ordinarily are very dry. A
pan of water on the stove or on the register and damp moss
among the pots, will afford plants the necessary humidity.</p>

<p>The foliage will need cleansing from time to time to free
it from dust. A bath tub provided with
a ready outlet for the water is an excellent
place for this purpose. The plants
may be turned on their sides and supported
on a small box above the bottom
of the tub. Then they may be freely
syringed without danger of making the
soil too wet. It is usually advisable not
to wet the flowers, however, especially
the white waxen kinds, like hyacinths.
The foliage of Rex begonias should be
cleansed with a piece of dry or only
slightly moist cotton. But if the leaves
can be quickly dried off by placing them in the open air
on mild days, or moderately near the stove, the foliage may
be syringed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 196px;">
<img src="images/245-windowbox.jpg" width="196" height="242" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A window-box</p>
</div>

<p>The window-box in the room will be seen near at hand,
so may be more or less ornamental in character. The sides
may be covered with ornamental tile held in place by moulding;
or a light lattice-work of wood surrounding the box
is pretty. But a neatly made and strong box of about the
dimensions mentioned on <a href="#Page_242">page 242</a>, with a strip of moulding
at the top and bottom, answers just as well; and if painted
green, or some neutral shade, only the plants will be seen or
thought of. Brackets, jardinieres and stands may be purchased
of any of the larger florists.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
The window-box may consist of merely the wooden box;
but a preferable arrangement is to make it about eight
inches deep instead of six, then have the tinsmith make a
zinc tray to fit the box. This is provided with a false
wooden bottom, with cracks for drainage, two inches
above the real bottom of the tray. The plants will then
have a vacant space below them into which drainage water
may pass. Such a box may be thoroughly watered as the
plants require without danger of the water running on the
carpet. Of course, a faucet should be provided at some
suitable point on a level with the bottom of the tray, to
permit of its being drained every day or so if the water
tends to accumulate. It would not do to allow the water to
remain long; especially should it never rise to the false
bottom, as then the soil would be kept too wet.</p>

<p>Some persons attach the box to the window, or support it
on brackets attached below the window-sill; but a preferable
arrangement is to support the box on a low and light
stand of suitable height provided with rollers. It may then
be drawn back from the window, turned around from time to
time to give the plants light on all sides, or turned with the
handsome side in as may be desired, and so on.</p>

<p>Often the plants are set directly in the soil; but if they
are kept in pots they may be rearranged, changed about to
give those which need it more light, etc. Larger plants
which are to stand on shelves or brackets may be in porous
earthenware pots; but the smaller ones which are to fill the
window-box may be placed in heavy paper pots. The sides
of these are flexible, and the plants in them therefore may
be crowded close together with great economy in space.
When pots are spaced, damp sphagnum or other moss among
them will hold them in place, keep the soil from drying out
too rapidly, and at the same time give off moisture, so
grateful to the foliage.</p>

<p>In addition to the stand, or box, a bracket for one or
more pots on either side of the window, about one-third or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
half way up, will be desirable. The bracket should turn on
a basal hinge or pivot, to admit of swinging it forward or
backward. These bracket plants usually suffer for moisture,
and are rather difficult to manage.</p>

<p>Florists now usually grow plants suitable for Window-Gardens
and winter flowering, and any intelligent florist, if
asked, will take pleasure in making out a suitable collection.
The plants should be ordered early in the fall; the
florist will then not be so crowded for time and can give the
matter better attention.</p>

<p>Most of the plants suitable for the winter Window-Garden
belong to the groups which florists grow in their medium and
cool houses. The former are given a night temperature of
about 60°, the latter about 50°. In each case the temperature
is 10 to 15° higher for the daytime. Five degrees of variation
below these temperatures will be allowable without any
injurious effects; even more may be borne, but not without
more or less check to the plants. In bright, sunny weather
the day temperature may be higher than in cloudy and
dark weather.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Bulbs in the Window-Garden.</i>&mdash;The single Roman hyacinth
is an excellent house plant. Its flowers are small, but
they are graceful and especially well suited for cutting. The
bulbs are easily forced, and are managed like other hyacinths.
The secret of forcing the Dutch bulbs and most
others is to pot them and then, after watering the pots,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
set them away in a cool, dark place until the pot is filled
with roots. They may be placed in the cellar “to root up,”
or be buried 3 or 4 inches deep in the soil. It is well to
delay potting them until such time as
they can be kept cool while forming
their roots. A temperature of about 40°
to 45° suits them during this period. In
most cases it is well to select pots 5 or 6
inches in diameter and place from three
to six bulbs in a pot, according to the
size of the bulbs and the plants. The
pot having been filled with soil, it is only
necessary to press them down till the
tip, or about one-fourth, shows above
the soil. After this a slight jarring or
sharp rap will settle the soil. They are
then watered and set away, as before
mentioned. If kept dark and cool they
will need no more watering until they
are brought out and begin to grow, when they may be
watered freely.</p>

<p>Hyacinths, tulips and narcissus all require about the
same treatment. When well rooted, which will be in six or
eight weeks, they are brought out and given a temperature
of some 55° to 60° till the flowers appear, when they should
be kept in a cooler temperature, say 50°.</p>

<p>The Easter lily is managed the same way, only, to hasten
its flowers, it should be kept at not lower than 60° at
night. Warmer will be better. Lilies may be covered an
inch or more deep.</p>

<p>Freesias may be potted six or more in a pot of mellow
soil, and then started into growth at once. At first they
might be given a night temperature of 50°, and 55° to 60°
when they have begun to grow.</p>

<p>Bulbs like the snowdrop and crocus are planted several
or a dozen in a pot and buried, or treated like hyacinths;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
but they are very sensitive to heat, and require only to be
given the light when they have started to grow, without any
forcing. Forty to 45° will be as warm as they ever need be
kept. See the article on <a href="#bulbs"><i>Bulbs</i></a>; also, the advice given for
the various plants under their respective names.</p>

<p><i>Pests.</i>&mdash;Window-Garden pests are discussed under <a href="#insects"><i>Insects</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Winter-killing</b> is induced by a late fall growth,
and also by a dry, unprotected soil. All tender woody plants
should be well ripened before cold weather comes: cease
tillage early: do not apply stimulating manures late in the
season. Mulch all tender or half hardy plants (<a href="#mulch">see <i>Mulch</i></a>).
Even hardy plants are benefited by a mulch. When possible,
it is better to bend plants to the ground and cover
them than to wrap them up as they stand; but this cannot
be done with tall or stiff subjects. Wrapping in straw or
burlaps affords excellent protection, but it is possible to
wrap too heavily. A barrel, less the heads, may be set over
small plants and then filled with leaves or other loose litter;
or a cylinder of wire chicken-screen may be substituted for
the barrel. Remove the protection in the spring before the
buds start. See that mice do not nest in the barrel or
in the mulch.</p>

<p><a name="Z" id="Z"></a><b>Zinnia.</b> Showy hardy annuals. The old formal
type of Zinnias has given place to a race of freer forms
which are excellent plants either for color effect or for
cutting. The colors have been varied and brightened, the
flowers doubled and the plants dwarfed. Seed should be
sown in a hotbed or house in March, transplanted once at
least before planting out, and set in well enriched soil. Or,
the seed may be sown where the plants are to grow. The
tall varieties (3 feet) should stand 18 to 24 inches apart.
These are best for masses at a distance.</p>

<span class="lg">THE SURVIVAL OF THE UNLIKE:</span>
<span class="med-lg">A Collection of Evolution Essays Suggested
by the Study of Domestic Plants.</span> By L. H.
BAILEY, Professor of Horticulture in the Cornell
University.</p>

<p class="center sm"><b>FOURTH EDITION&mdash;515 PAGES&mdash;22 ILLUSTRATIONS&mdash;$2.00</b></p>

<p>To those interested in the underlying philosophy
of plant life, this volume, written in a most entertaining
style, and fully illustrated, will prove welcome.
It treats of the modification of plants under
cultivation upon the evolution theory, and its attitude
on this interesting subject is characterized
by the author’s well-known originality and independence
of thought. Incidentally, there is stated
much that will be valuable and suggestive to the
working horticulturist, as well as to the man or
woman impelled by a love of nature to horticultural
pursuits. It may well be called, indeed, a
philosophy of horticulture, in which all interested
may find inspiration and instruction.</p>

<p class="sm"><span class="smcap">The Survival of the Unlike</span> comprises thirty essays touching
upon The General Fact and Philosophy of Evolution (The Plant
Individual, Experimental Evolution, Coxey’s Army and the Russian
Thistle, Recent Progress, etc.); Expounding the Fact and Causes of
Variation (The Supposed Correlations of Quality in Fruits, Natural
History of Synonyms, Reflective Impressions, Relation of Seed-bearing
to Cultivation, Variation after Birth, Relation between
American and Eastern Asian Fruits, Horticultural Geography, Problems
of Climate and Plants, American Fruits, Acclimatization, Sex
in Fruits, Novelties, Promising Varieties, etc.); and Tracing the
Evolution of Particular Types of Plants (the Cultivated Strawberry,
Battle of the Plums, Grapes, Progress of the Carnation, Petunia,
The Garden Tomato, etc.).</p>

FRUITS.</span> By L. H. BAILEY, Professor
of Horticulture in the Cornell University.</p>

<p class="center sm"><b>472 PAGES&mdash;125 ILLUSTRATIONS&mdash;$2.00</b></p>

<p>In this entertaining volume, the origin and development
of the fruits peculiar to North America
are inquired into, and the personality of those horticultural
pioneers whose almost forgotten labors
have given us our most valuable fruits is touched
upon. There has been careful research into the
history of the various fruits, including inspection
of the records of the great European botanists who
have given attention to American economic botany.
The conclusions reached, the information presented,
and the suggestions as to future developments, cannot
but be valuable to any thoughtful fruit-grower,
while the terse style of the author is at its best in
his treatment of the subject.</p>

<p class="sm"><span class="smcap">The Evolution of our Native Fruits</span> discusses The Rise of
the American Grape (North America a Natural Vineland, Attempts
to Cultivate the European Grape, The Experiments of the Dufours,

<p>There are two ways of looking at nature. The
<i>old way</i>, which you have found so unsatisfactory,
was to classify everything&mdash;to consider leaves, roots,
and whole plants as formal herbarium specimens,
forgetting that each had its own story of growth
and development, struggle and success, to tell.
Nothing stifles a natural love for plants more effectually
than that old way.</p>

<p>The new way is to watch the life of every growing
thing, to look upon each plant as a living
creature, whose life is a story as fascinating as the
story of any favorite hero. “Lessons with Plants”
is a book of stories, or rather, a book of plays, for
we can see each chapter acted out if we take the
trouble to <i>look</i> at the actors.</p>

<p class="sm">“I have spent some time in most delightful examination of it, and the
longer I look, the better I like it. I find it not only full of interest, but
eminently suggestive. I know of no book which begins to do so much to
open the eyes of the student&mdash;whether pupil or teacher&mdash;to the wealth of
meaning contained in simple plant forms. Above all else, it seems to be
full of suggestions that help one to learn the language of plants, so they
may talk to him.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Darwin L. Bardwell</span>, <i>Superintendent of Schools, Binghamton</i>.</p>

<p class="sm">“It is an admirable book, and cannot fail both to awaken interest in
the subject, and to serve as a helpful and reliable guide to young students
of plant life. It will, I think, fill an important place in secondary schools,
and comes at an opportune time, when helps of this kind are needed and
eagerly sought.”&mdash;Professor <span class="smcap">V. M. Spalding</span>, <i>University of Michigan</i>.</p>

<p>“This book is made for the pupil: ‘Lessons With Plants’
was made to supplement the work of the teacher.” This is the
opening sentence of the preface, showing that the book is a
companion to “Lessons With Plants,” which has now become a
standard teacher’s book. The present book is the handsomest
elementary botanical text-book yet made. The illustrations
illustrate. They are artistic. The old formal and unnatural
Botany is being rapidly outgrown. The book disparages mere
laboratory work of the old kind: the pupil is taught to see things
as they grow and behave. The pupil who goes through this book
will understand the meaning of the plants which he sees day
by day. It is a revolt from the dry-as-dust teaching of botany.
It cares little for science for <a name="ad-corr1" id="ad-corr1">science’s</a> sake, but its point of view
is nature-study in its best sense. The book is divided into four
parts, any or all of which may be used in the school: the plant
itself; the plant in its environment; histology, or the minute
structure of plants; the kinds of plants (with a key, and descriptions
of 300 common species). The introduction contains
advice to teachers. The book is brand new from start to
finish.</p>

<p class="sm">“An exceedingly attractive text-book.”&mdash;<i>Educational Review.</i></p>

<p class="sm">“It is a school book of the modern methods.”&mdash;<i>The Dial.</i></p>

<p class="sm">“It would be hard to find a better manual for schools or for individual
use.”&mdash;<i>The Outlook.</i></p>

HORTICULTURE:</span> By L. H. BAILEY, of

<p>This great work comprises directions for the cultivation
of horticultural crops and original descriptions
of all the species of fruits, vegetables, flowers
and ornamental plants known to be in the market in
the United States and Canada. “It has the unique
distinction of presenting for the first time, in a carefully
arranged and perfectly accessible form, the best
knowledge of the best specialists in America upon
gardening, fruit-growing, vegetable culture, forestry,
and the like, as well as exact botanical information....
The contributors are eminent cultivators or
specialists, and the arrangement is very systematic,
clear and convenient for ready reference.”</p>

<p class="sm">“We have here a work which every ambitions gardener will wish to place
on his shelf beside his Nicholson and his Loudon, and for such users of it a
too advanced nomenclature would have been confusing to the last degree.
With the safe names here given, there is little liability to serious perplexity.
There is a growing impatience with much of the controversy concerning
revision of names of organisms, whether of plants or animals. Those investigators
who are busied with the ecological aspects of organisms, and
also those who are chiefly concerned with the application of plants to the
arts of agriculture, horticulture, and so on, care for the names of organisms
under examination only so far as these aid in recognition and identification.
To introduce unnecessary confusion is a serious blunder. Professor Bailey
has avoided the risk of confusion. In short, in range, treatment and editing,
the Cyclopedia appears to be emphatically useful; ... a work worthy
of ranking by the side of the Century Dictionary.”&mdash;<i>The Nation.</i></p>
